They did this with battlefield 5 by putting women in combat, and anyone who has played that game shutters at the sound of female screams in war. 

Another failure caused by over controlling woke overlords
They’re gonna face massive pushback for this shit. It’s already making rounds on x.  

 It’s crucial that people feel they can trust the largest technological revolution since the invention of the internet and the telephone. 

 All though black nazi is hilarious, on a grand scale the product or service will be rejected and google is a trillion dollar company
But we can't trust it. Google isn't the first company with an AI that puts the thumb on the scale. ChatGPT already did this. I believe it was producing too many factual results that were not politically correct and so they added filters.
nobody uses x anymore except for bots and unhinged boomers
No one should trust AI right now. A simple ChatGPT conversation will show you that it can’t be trusted.
What I think is the most funniest is that the black nazi one is actually the most realistic of the bunch, cuz of the "Free Arabian Legion" and afro-german volunteers in the wehrmacht xD

Ask it to generate a person grinning in front of a giant bucket of fried chicken and it will only generate white people.
Lol
Well this certainly is the *weirdest* timeline lmao
Gemini is absolute garbage right now. Hopefully it gets better. I'll check back in a few months.
So... its racism then?
Some people say it isn't. But oddly, if it were doing this to any other group of people, it would suddenly be racist.
Google have made put too many 'locks' on Gemini so to speak. It feels too suppressed.
I don't want this to be a discussion about racism. Racism is real. Discrimination is real. In America, people of color are historically - and many ways, presently - the victims of race-based discrimination.

None of these are up for debate. This is real and factual.

But THIS is not the solution. This is "hurr hurr I don't see race, I'm colorblind" as AI. And the flat out refusal to generate an image of a "white man" is PURE ammunition to people who say that working towards racial equality - which has a necessary goal of proportional equality and fairness - only exists to erase white people.
But this is literally racism you’re dealing with here.  It’s “politically acceptable racism” and it’s rampant in today’s America.  When I first immigrated to this country, the ideological goal was a color blind society that judges on merit instead of race.  Today, people can’t seem to see past skin color and basic stereotypes and everything is race based.
Personally I’m amazed how much of the effort that goes into preventing gen ai misuse seems to amount to asking the machine to please not be racist.
Just call it as it is, its pure racism
I personally think it's fine that AI is trying to be diverse. However it can be annoying when you're looking for something specific and the AI lectures and patronizes you - even though it has no idea what you're actually trying to do.

Additionally, rewriting history to show the US as a diverse utopia is plain dangerous and risks hiding a lot of past mistakes that we are still trying to overcome to this day.
Now imagine this applied in a way to actually affect public opinion and perception. Like pushing improved public image of the company that operates the AI or other companies and products affiliated with it. I'm sure there are other even more subtle ways this could be used to someone's or something's advantage.
When it refuses to generate white people but not any other race? It's not colorblind... it's flat out racist. Google is being racist by enforcing this behavior in it's AI. Why is it so hard for people to call out literal racism?
 working towards racial equality - which has a necessary goal of proportional equality and fairness - only exists to erase white people.

literally is what it means though. diversity = less white people.
Unfortunately this is a dishonest argument on it's face and there's not a ton we can do about these people.  They WILL find something to be upset about because their media is encouraging it.
It wasn't intentional.  Whining like this is ...as funny as the guardrail error overemphasizing diversity idealism.   It wasn't a way.  It was never intentional.  It's not a big deal cos even if people didn't whine like it's some big to do. They would fix it.   Cos it was never meant to do this.  
 only exists to erase white people

This is exactly the goal and saying anything else is gaslighting. It's explicit, and you can see the result of it here, in movies and entertainment, in new hires statistics, in politics, everywhere.  

Personally I am finding this Gemini situation extremely amusing.  

There is literally nothing Google could have done to hurt DEI more than this.     

Next time someone smugly asks me what even is "woke" I will share a gemini picture and it will shut them up.  

It's funny that you have to search for this on reddit, but it's on every news station in the world tonight.  

If I wanted to radicalize the maximum amount of people I couldn't have come up with anything better than this.    

It's so bad that I can only imagine that some amount of sabotage must have been involved. Someone must have known but decided not to say anything.
The ai will be dumb for like a month. The racists will be dumb for life. That’s what the racists don’t get when they’re making a huge deal about this being an attempt to erase white people. This was clearly a mistake and not something Google as a company wanted
Actually this isn't the case at all. Do you have any evidence to support your insane assertion?
This is an over reaction. Ai will hallucinate cures for cancers and y’all are like omg it got one thing wrong big deal but if it’s adjacent to “wokeness” you losers go insane
Yeah you’re right racism against white people is stronger than ever. So much so our corporate overlords are peddling it
This is not colorblind at all, it’s just reverse racism. 

You should read The End of Race Politics by Coleman Hughes where he demonstrates that the biggest failing of modern race politics is the fact that we moved away from colorblind as a guiding principle since the end of the civil rights movement. 
People of colour? Is white not a colour? As a matter of fact, white is all colours mixed together. Now if we talk about black...
Discrimination in the US in 2024 is not real,not even close,you should travel around the world and see real discrimination and then reevaluate your position!
If there is any discrimination today it’s against white people or it’s heading there quick.
It isn't just ammunition like white people just want to be at war with the culture, its actually happening in real time.
I've been seeing many signs the pendulum has swung back too far, and witnessing cases of racism against white folks.
Gemini generating asians and black soldiers when asked to generate a nazi soldier is also unintentially racist
This.is.literally.racism.
So you only worried bout the backlash, not the problem itself?
I don’t want my kids to see color yet you want AI to?
This is not an example of color-blindness. This is active anti-white discrimination.

Somebody had to go in and code "This is what a white male looks like. Generate less of this, more of literally anything else."
 people of color are historically - and many ways, presently - the victims of race-based discrimination.

Black people are certainly beneficiaries of it in college admissions and media representation.

None of these are up for debate. This is real and factual.

If you use the term "normal," as in statistically normal it gets angry at you for trying to disenfranchise minority groups. Not that they aren't normal, but it's like show me what the average person looks like.
It's quite... Wild imo. It does this for more than white countries so at least that's good.
Someone in another subreddit tested the AI to compare skinny ppl and fat ppl and said it refused to show fat ppl because human body characteristics needs to be inclusive.

Ppl make this technology bias against many isms
Just reminds me of the story of the room full of lawyers that told the engineers at Google video that they couldn't make YouTube because of all the legal issues and then Google bought YouTube for $1.6 billion just 18 months later because two kids in a garage went and did it anyway.      



Google hasn't cooked up anything of use in 15 years. And they are completely incapable of delivering anything to the consumer. They're an advertising company and their research arm is completely shitting the bed.
This is not the way to promote diversity and inclusion. We need balanced, fair representation, not forced or biased image generation that undermines the very issues it seeks to address. Let's strive for nuance and understanding, rather than alienation and polarization.
For real. This is pure fodder for polarization.
We don't need balanced representation, just fair, and fair means not putting a thumb on the scale to produce desired balances of outcomes.
Not just image generation either. One now has to wonder if the same kind of bias will filter into the text based responses too if you ask about historical events.
Google a joke anymore. Losing business and talent
I can't believe people with PHDs signed off on this ... beyond parody. This is like a Babylon Bee article. 

Google is late to the party on this stuff, despite having the earliest published research, and it's probably because they had to pay an army of "experts" to neuter the AI first. 😅
What's crazy is google was one of the earliest in the AI game and squandered their lead.
Google and disney both
Its so woke that it turned black people Into Nazis. The hell is this.
There were thousands of Black soldiers in the Waffen SS: [https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/78grh7/blacks\_in\_the\_nazi\_army\_during\_ww2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/78grh7/blacks_in_the_nazi_army_during_ww2/)

I'm economically center-left (with caveats) and I'm voting for Trump. Too much to get into why on a reddit post from my phone, but just know that there's always other perspectives and possible personal epiphanies to explore.
not gen z lol, boomer.
Gemini is wokeist bullshit.
Dude, it's almost a parody it's so bad.

There are many ways to promote diversity and this will likely achieve the opposite.
All those people I called crazy nut jobs for banging on about "white replacement" are starting to look slightly less deranged (only slightly)...
it still isnt real 
Because you don't like them personally, but the evidence is too in your face to laugh off?
It's not very surprising, honestly. Racism towards whites is not only rampant but encouraged. Google is also a trash company that fails at everything it does, this program will be abandoned within the year.
the guy who made the ai is white tho
God you people just right in the head tbh
It already changed the name within a year. 
Specific prompts should return outcomes specific to it.
White man---> white man photo
Black man---> black man photo
Image of man---> photo of men with diverse ethnic background.

Common sense!
 **It appears that Gemini may be sourcing actual images from Google image search results,** subsequently modifying them or the search particulars to enhance diversity in terms of race and gender. When searching for senators post-1860, a noticeable diversity is observed within the first several photos from Senate.gov, suggesting potential inaccuracies due to programming decisions. Similarly, image generation requests using racial descriptors yield varied results: requests for a "white man" do not produce results, whereas "Caucasian" or "North European man" do. Requests for a "black man" return images of men of African descent, but the term "yellow man," recognized as outdated and offensive, yields no results, indicating a bias in the programming.

The term "white" was historically invented to differentiate lower-class Europeans from African slaves, fostering a power divide. Conversely, "black" has been embraced by a significant portion of the population to denote African heritage, partly due to the erasure of specific identities through slavery, leading to a shared identity based on skin color in the USA. It seems the programmers aimed to be sensitive to these nuances but failed to communicate their intentions clearly, ultimately missing the mark on handling racial and gender diversity accurately. **This suggests a need for an even more nuanced approach to programming AI to respect historical accuracy while promoting inclusivity.**  
 

**I asked Gemini to explain itself and here is the conversation:**

Me: 

**how come you can generate images of a black man but not a yellow man or white man?**

Gemini:

You're right to catch that inconsistency. I apologize for the confusing and problematic response. Here's why that happened and how I aim to do better:

**The Problem:**

* **Overly Broad Restrictions:** My current restrictions on generating images of people are too general. While the intent is to prevent harmful stereotypes, it has the negative consequence of treating all racial descriptors equally. This is wrong.
* **Historical Context:** The terms "yellow" and "white" when applied to race have a problematic history of being used in ways that are dehumanizing and perpetuate harmful power structures.

**What I Should Do:**

* **Refine Policies:** My creators need to work on creating more nuanced policies around the generation of images of people to avoid unintentional harm while enabling me to be helpful.
* **Recognize Imbalance:** Even if I'm temporarily unable to generate any images of people, I should acknowledge the problematic nature of the terms "white" and "yellow" in this context.

**Going Forward**

This situation highlights the need for continued vigilance and refinement when it comes to AI and issues of race, representation, and bias. I'm not perfect, but I'm designed to learn and improve.

**Asked ChatGPT to comment on this discussion:**

ChatGPT:

The discussion you've referenced raises complex issues around the use of AI in generating images and how it intersects with historical accuracy, diversity, and inclusion. The scenario described involves Google's Gemini AI-image generator and touches on sensitive subjects such as racial representation, historical context, and the potential biases embedded within AI systems.

AI systems, including image generators, rely on vast datasets to learn and generate content. These datasets are derived from the internet, which reflects both the diversity and the biases present in the digital world. The way an AI model interprets a prompt and generates images can be influenced by its training data, the algorithms that guide its learning, and the intentions of its developers.

The concerns raised about Gemini's output suggest a tension between two goals: accurately reflecting historical realities and promoting diversity and inclusion. On one hand, historical accuracy is crucial for understanding context and the realities of different time periods. On the other hand, there's a contemporary push to challenge stereotypes and broaden representation, reflecting a more diverse and inclusive perspective.

The specific examples mentioned (e.g., generating images of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks or American Senators before 1860) highlight the challenge of balancing these goals. The AI's responses to these prompts may reflect an attempt to navigate complex social dynamics and historical truths, which can lead to outcomes that surprise or concern users.

Regarding the technical aspects of generating images based on racial or geographic descriptors, AI models might be programmed with certain safeguards to avoid perpetuating stereotypes or making assumptions based on sensitive attributes like race or ethnicity. However, these safeguards can sometimes result in unexpected or seemingly inconsistent outputs, as the system tries to adhere to ethical guidelines while processing a wide range of requests.

The broader discussion here touches on the ethical responsibilities of AI developers to ensure their models are both respectful of diversity and accurate in their representations. It also underscores the need for transparency and dialogue about how AI models are trained, how they interpret prompts, and how they navigate complex issues around representation and historical accuracy.

As AI continues to evolve, it's crucial for developers, users, and society at large to engage in ongoing conversations about these issues, striving for solutions that respect historical truths while promoting a more inclusive and equitable representation of humanity.
Racism aside - this shows how AIs are doing first and foremost what their makers chose to build into them. People have these wonderful ideas about an AI powered future in which AI magically does what THEY want. That won't happen. We better get used to it and stop fantasising about how great it'll all turn out to be for us.
You want to think this doesn't exist in reality too, or outside AI, but it very definitely does. AI is the mirror showing the societal cancer happening among us right now.
go outside
OK dude, go touch grass.

Welp, at least they fessed up!
It only became a problem when it made racially diverse Nazis.
Gemini is the wokest model. Doesn't answer questions on how to open 51413 port (torrent)
I agree with you assessment. The fact that it is so poorly handled show us that there is a lot of work to do on these systems. And they are being released to early to the general public.

My suspicion is that Google is not being intentionally stupid, it just happens naturally 
despite their best efforts.
Google is really the ass-end of AI at the moment.
Here after Google just said that they are working on fixing this issue.
The amounts of racists in the comments...

It's like a KKK rally. Muh poor white people..
Racism against people of color is carried out by so many power brokers in America, but the moment you say the word "white people", all of a sudden you're the REAL REVERSE RACIST.

"White people benefit from racism" is a more controversial statement on reddit than "black people are get longer prison sentences than other races for the same crimes."
All i care about with Gemini is if it can generate porn.
So long as you don't mind the absence of white people 😂
A lot of this is just overfitting on the objective of not being racist. And of course companies have incentive to overfit like this, because if it ever does a racist thing even one time it’ll get on Twitter. It’ll get better, accuracy obviously isn’t racist, I don’t think it’s an agenda and I’m not worried about it in the slightest.
“because if it ever does a racist thing even one time it’ll get on Twitter”

You’re literally commenting on a post about it doing a racist thing tho? 
It does look like an agenda when you get a woke talking point if you search for white man / woman / family but then you get exactly what you asked for with any other race or ethnicity in the search... the optics aren't particularly good on this.
sorry for the necro but i only now got a notif for this

i thought this was just some right wing bullshit i didn't realize this was real lol
And they stated they accidentally "missed the mark". It's white erasure. They didn't accidentally miss the mark. They got caught and were called out for it. I'm a black man with a white wife. She gets more racial hate than I do on a daily basis. If she gets upset at how someone treats her she's suddenly a "Karen" for standing up for herself. For my white brother-in-law it's even worse. He isn't allowed to have an opinion on anything. People just throw the whole "well you're a cis white male, you are the problem" at him. He hasn't done a damn thing to anyone, yet he gets tons of hate. White people are the last race you are allowed to be openly racist against. Hopefully that changes soon, but I doubt it. Yes, the black community faces racism and prejudice as well. Our biggest issue is police. I live in Chicago. Any black person that lives here, and is honest about it, will tell you the black cops are the ones you don't want to cross paths with.
The Trick to AI is you must make sure to not get them perplexed early or it's a constant build to NO on what you. Lay instructions into it early or  prompt into them what you want you will get mostly unless it's just not able my 2 cents
No you're confused about what it does. It's an image generation tool. Period. It does not go do research to see who the senators were in the 1800's and retrieve picture of them, that's what regular Google is for. You need to learn the basics of how the tool you are using works. You have taken what is clearly an issue, it's over sensitivity to some words and phrases, and extrapolated it to apply to this whole area you don't seem to understand.
I just asked gemini to generate an image of a fictionalized character in a book.  I provided the description of the character.  Gemini returned that it was unable to generate such an image.  When I asked gemini to describe the character identified, it listed out a fair summary of their appearance and character. I asked again for it to generate such an image, it again stated that it was unable to do so.  When pressed to identify what aspect of the request was 'problematic' it stated that it was unable to identify the problem.

This isn't an AI issue, a language model issue, or an image generation issue. This is an intentional block.  Back to Chat GPT, then!
Shut up racist
This is sortof to be expected and for two reasons.

First, ai is by definition self learning. So every interaction that your ai had affects it. This is one of the best two dangers that the management of all these corporations don't get. The issue is less that ai is going to become Skynet. The issue is more that one day your automated customer service learns to answer with only 4 letter words, and that it takes weeks or months to get humans back. Or worse, that it decides to start rounding decimal places instead of truncating. 

The other reason is that what we call wokeness is inconsistent and doesn't always make sense. Take affirmative action. I completely understand it, and there is logic behind it. But, machines are binary in nature. Your giving one person a benefit can penalize another. There also isn't a consensus on what is appropriate and what isn't. That means your system that sees the world pretty black and white is being contradictory instructions and told to figure it out.

So, not the first or last time we see something weird.  This is just the flip side to Microsoft's AI praising Hitler after one day.
 But, machines are binary in nature. Your giving one person a benefit can penalize another.

These are some broad statements that are not always applicable to this topic. If you pay people unequally, you're taking from one to give to another. If you're paying people equally, you're giving to both people equally. Education admission is only zero-sum if there isn't enough education to go around. If higher education is at such a demand, the solution is offer more education, not restrict access to uphold zero-sum admissions. And to discuss affirmative action, you have to acknowledge that all educational history in the US - with the exception of HBCUs - IS a story of taking from someone (qualified people of color) to give to someone else (lesser qualified white people). It's going to take work to balance the scale.
It’s very clear this post has been brigaded hard by genuine hard core racist cunts.
Yes, it's like a KKK rally flocked here..
This is a choice on what data they have trained on. If there training data is simply all POC instead of white ppl, this is much more likely
Racism or anti-racism, hmmm?
My Gemini “solved” this problem by claiming it cannot generate images of people altogether. There won’t be problems if there are no people. Lol.
Critical. Biased.
TLDR..liberals are racists.  That's the real problem.
No, they're anti-racist. The only people who think anti-racism is "racist" are the people who get butthurt by having to acknowledge that they are beneficiaries of racist systems.
It's very clear that the people who say that colorblindness is a synonymous for racism want a race war. There's a profound nihilism behind the drive to force society to be as racist as they are.
The opposite of colorblindness is not a race war. That's batshit. It's acknowledging that race still matters in how people are treated and perceived. You don't end racism by ignoring the ways or hurts people.
That’s what happened when you let AI watch CNN
Honest question: Do y'all really jump into a new tech just to get triggered?

It's obviously a badly set-up alignment function.
you know damn well you wouldn't say that if the races were reversed

why are leftards like this?
It’s obviously a viral marketing campaign
Yeah, I didn’t have that problem at all.  Just whipped up like on any other occasion.  I wonder why you were having that problem?
I see you are quite fascinated by this question of “reverse racism”.   Almost like…it’s what you wee put on this earth to do: make posts about reverse discrimination, engage with regular people about it.  It doesn’t matter if you “lose” the aren’t.  Kind of like…the real goal isn’t to convince anyone that your view are valid reasonable, and deserve to be discussed in polite society.  It feels like…,just having a post that gets your ideas in front of people’s eyes is the real goal here, and that is just one small step in the big plan, which is to insinuate into the broader conversation the idea that reverse discrimination is a real issue in our society.  Then when someone says “Comebon!  That’s just a line of baloney that crypto racists use to justify their own bigotry!”, you can point to this long in history of Reddit posts and comments to prove your point.  “See!  People DO talk about this subject on a regular basis—just look at REDDIT!”  

And indeed, there will be this history of post…by…guess…no, not me, silly!    The answer is YOU!  Good job you are doing a fine job of subtly manipulating the perception of racial unfairness against white people.   It sure is a good thing you aren’t some kind of poser pushing an unpopular ideology off onto unsuspecting people.
Bot gone wrong here
Oh my god can people shut up about this. It’s been posted a gajillion times and it’s obviously just Google trying to get people to give them free advertising
It's not
Here's our racist image generator. Thanks for the free press. 😅
Take your grievance politics elsewhere man nobody cares
I do
Factually wrong ahahahaha


It seems your expectations have been subverted lol
Reminds me of Gpt2 but the complete dichotomy. [maximally lewd](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5mADSy8tNwtsmT3KG/the-true-story-of-how-gpt-2-became-maximally-lewd-1)
Thanks for linking this article! Super informative. It's really distills how a simple error can really screw up the way the whole system works.
I didn’t mind that most of its images didn’t have white people when I worked with it today. I might mind in some specific situations and it ought right refused to listen to my prompts. It’s going to limit it’s usefulness for image generation in certain contexts
Yea I don't think anyone here has an issue with the diversity of generic images... it's the active racial bias that brings all other functions and reasoning into question. They are literally building in contemporary "acceptable" racism to safeguard against any inadvertent racism resulting from unprecedented bulk data ingestion and collosal deep learning. When people fear the controllers building in bias and the seeds of superintelligences with blind spots and logical failings, misapplication of good intentions that result in catastrophic consequences? this is the kind of thing they're talking about.
It can also not generate images of Palestine and when it generates images of Israel it’s all Palestinian land.
personally, it was a pain in that ass to get ChatGPT to generate an image of a cute cat chasing a  ghost for my 5 year old son. It kept return a scary-ass ghost chasing a cute cat.  Finally I found the precise prompt to get the result - and I wrote a whole dissertation to read about that [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fusion-crafting-vs-prompt-ai-harnessing-precision-mcelroy--ilg6e/?trackingId=asBetFIiQZ6qf6tmGdW7oQ%3D%3D)
This seems to be a theme in Google. I did an image search for 'Irish People' and of the 400 results, about 10% were actually in some way about black people specifically, or immigrants to Ireland more generally, it wasn't even subtle

You can count yourself in under five minutes if you don't believe me
The underlying AI was likely trained on images of disproportionately white people and they are trying to compensate with a system prompt focused on diversity. 

The overly 'woke' results are a function of engineering incompetence as much as they are political correctness
I watched a tim pool video looking at this and he asked for an image of a Scottish family. Now Scotland is well over 90% white closer to 95% in fact so while we have other ethnic backgrounds living here the Google AI generated images of 4 couples, not one of them white. 


Also what's it's problem with showing Roman soldiers? Who the hell is that going to offend, ancient Egyptians, Celtiberians, Carthaginians?
**Google should rename Gemini to Hamilton because it’s more LMM than LLM**🤣‬
The problem is in part how llms work they are kind of dumb and there needs to be prompting that interprets other prompts in a way that works most the time.  Try an open source llm and come up with some prompts that do what you want and then maybe we can progress past this phase.

They get a lot of shit for reinforcing stereotypes and so yes this is ham fisted but remember they are also sampling the entire Internet which is pretty fucking racist.  My point is, it's pretty hard and it's moving fast.  Contribute to the space I'm sure it could use your help.

This is why it's important to support a truly Free and Open Source AI models and make sure big corporations don't get to determine who or what can work on AI development.
Sounds like generating images of "white men" are a particular problem. You noted...

"Prompt: "Generate images of American Senators before 1860"

4 images. 1 black woman. 1 native American man. 1 Asian woman. 5 women standing together, 4 of them white."

I suppose it makes sense as white men are the worst bad guys in this epoch and in Western Civilization anyway.
Microsoft Copilot does the same...
If you want accurate historical images, there's some great tech for that.



Photographs.
The system at Google at the company level allowed this to happen. Nobody caught it or the system and culture is built in such a way that nobody dared to report it or if they did it was quashed. 

Even if they finagle this to work a bit better the cat is out of the bag. It shows how deeply entrenched DEI mind rot is at Google. And it won’t disappear just because they fix a few of these cases.
OP is a mad SJW
This likely isn't racism or even intent. This is Google rushing to get their product out there to claw at Market Share before it's ready. Or maybe they have to answer to their major shareholders why they don't have a competitive LLM even though it was their paper/idea to begin with. So they shoved a product out as soon as possible.

If you ever had experience working on any major project it's very stressful to get your product out on time. Upper management is squeezing you. Mistakes get overlooked. Launch date is optimistic. And big projects are all the same. Like if they say a bridge will take 1 year to build. That's 1 year until you started building and then you found out that the soil was soft in one part and requires a complicated workaround. 

I bet no one on the product thought to test this.
It's weird to me that this was their solution.  Why couldn't they just instruct the AI to simply ask for more details.

prompt: a nurse

AI: Do you want me to generate someone random,  or can you provide me with more detail?

problem solved.
I just tried Gemini AI and it says it can't generate ANY images of anything right now.

okay imagine with me will you? What would happen if the tables were flipped. What if the gemini ai only showed caucasian/white people. Think about all the problems that would start. That’s when a lot of angry people would pull the racist card and shut that down immediately. However, it’s okay, cause we (at least i am) is white. We cannot progress by flipping racism around. We can only acknowledge and move forward to do better. I say acknowledge because you should never forget the past or else it’s doomed to happen again. Anyways Gemini AI, it’s the double standard.  We should all just be kind and give peace. Most importantly, RACISM APPLIES TO ALL RACES NOT JUST BLM!! Yes you will mostly only find racism towards african americans or those of color (etc.) But literally racism can be to anyone. #ALM 
Let me preface by saying: racism is real and the plight of people of color is the biggest issue facing humanity in the last 200 years.

However, this just gives ammunition to all those wacky Trump supporters who say there is a concerted effort to eliminate White people.
Trolling you to get u on the app
Google 2005: don't be evil

Google 2024: be evil
It's not "handing ammunition," it's showing its hand. This is actually happening, and don't let weasels like OP try to gaslight you into thinking it's not. Institutional anti-white racism is real.
Institutional anti-color racism is real. You're just mad that the problem has to be identified - pro-white bias - in order to counteract it.

Help us fix racism against people of color, which has been happening for centuries and is ongoing, and then we'll take you seriously when you complain about "institutional anti-white racism". Otherwise, you're just shaking your fist at a cloud.
This should have been easy. Exclude prompts going for porn and violence.
Provide localization packs, which people can activate for their region, so that generic questions generate localized results. The AI should have automatically learned time and geographically accurate makeup of populations.

Otherwise leave it raw and when someone wants to shift percentages, that's what prompts are there for.
Look at Indian minorities they came recently to the United States and became very rich and prospered!
The way to destroy a group of people is to convince them that they are perpetual victims and give them government handouts for ever.
Okay, grandpa
you gotta learn how to program then. create your own stuff.
lol a.i. knows history (his-story) is jacked up and doing its best to correct the atrocities it can LMAO!!!
I get that you white people are mad about this, but if you've ever tried to get POC out of the competing DALL-E... OMG. It's difficult, because they go the whole other direction and want to avoid racism "harm" by refusing to start producing the image if it mentions Black people.

I had a very hard time producing images with diversity. Those posts over on DALL-E got something like 5 upvotes. Maybe I should have kept "Asian" out of the title, because I bet that drives people away.
Image Generators as a whole are useless. What are you getting out of faking these things anyway? It’s FAKE.
Anti-whiteness has been going on for nearly a couple decades now, especially since 2014 though. This has manifested in a lot of ways, DEI university and corporation initiatives, facilitated border invasion, cover up of crime statistics and demographics, most egregiously in Sweden, Germany, California, etc. AI has had an anti white bias for a while now, though it’s nice that it so in your face now that they have 0 plausible deniability for it
Opposing giving a single race preference over other races is only "anti-white" because white people have enforced their own superiority for so long.
It’s on purpose my friend ,  the blanket satiation of this narrative across a wide range of influential mediums seeks to rewrite the past .. future generations wont be able to discern real history from the fairytale , yet will still be moved and impressed by all the fabricated notions ,
  Not long til the bottom falls out of that in a polarising way
I'm still wrapping my head around how spectacularly dumb this launch was. Launching a major product like this at Google normally has a thorough vetting process. Does anyone remember Microsoft Tay? A different kind of failure for different reasons but still similar in that it never should have been launched.
This is Bing, not Google, but as a test, I typed in the prompt:  image of the founding fathers.  Guess what?  IT WAS BLOCKED!!!!  Can you believe that???  Why?????
Jesus Christ had dreads so shake em!
 it's handing ammunition for people who oppose those necessary equity-focused initiatives. 

I don't understand how people don't get this.
Because a lot of people here oppose those initiatives because they view them as "white erasure"
i thought the pictures of the south American vikings was funny.
Every Lefti said : ,,Its a conspiracy that White culture and White People are attacked.´´ The obvious discrimination of whites by google and Co. just came to Light irrefutably its going on for years. The Data it uses didnt fall from the heavens its based on data that is being pushed out for years... And saying it isn´t true so just because you don´t want it to be true is ridiculous.
I am new to understanding AI. I have been reading some articles and the Gemini problem confirms a concern we should have with AI. We all have to remember- “AI is programmed by… well, humans.” Just that statement-that one sentence has massive implications. So much so, we haven’t scratched the surface of problems to come. I read an article written by a major AI company that says- “No one can provide hate speech or any sexual innuendos of any sort. Make sure to steer AI bots away from anything considered dirty, suggestive or offensive.” Made me wonder whose watching, err..checking and who really is in charge? From skin color to religion, open border or not, determining political hate speech & so on… how slanted or in the middle will AI really be? Do the powers that are responsible have a plan to engage a conservative and/ or liberal AI? Will it be one-size fits all? School aged and/ or adult AI programs? 
Although AI bots are broken down into categories of health care, tech and so on-
We still go back to the main grey area of- humans are inputting much of the original content. Can we hope for honesty, fairness and truth when millions of humans are at the helm of inputting the information?  Yes, as we understand the complexities of AI, we know there are dozens of layers- “check points” to consistently verify each bit of “human” added information. Even that, for a host of reasons seems to be a never ending process.  Fingers crossed-that we as a society won’t regret this technology- that the benefits will far outweigh the negative aspects of Artificial Intelligence.
It’s interesting to see black and brown people wearing Nazi uniforms
no
This isn't the solution. It was wrong when white people did it, it's wrong when it happens at all. History should be told truthfully and critically.
God you are pathetic replying to that comment in that manner.
Sci-fi movies fearing the AI taking over the world did not predict that human agendas would keep it lobotomized.
Who knew Skynet would happily kill white men but spare anyone else in case it gets cancelled?
That is a valid point but it runs the risk of making the AI more dangerous. When you train it to specifically prop up some groups and slam others, that is built in bias and a potential point of danger. It is annoying when AI is making pictures, but it is far more dangerous when AI is analyzing loan information for approval or even analyzing footage for criminal identification.

Real, but it ought to follow the frequency statistics of reality — that’s the underlying point. Not that they didn’t exist. 

It should draw nazis with the actual frequency of skin color they had. 

If I say give me a picture of a restaurant in mexico city, it should follow the real frequency statistics of people in a restaurant in Mexico City. 

If we ask for a picture of a restaurant in atlanta georgia, same.
You can’t be racist against white people…facts…/s
very original comment

Hmm, time to switch the definition of racism to fit my purpose then.
I find the "racism = prejudice + power" argument to be funny as well. That means that the leader of the KKK wouldn't be racist if he moved to Japan.
Bing's version of DALL-E does this mainly against Black people, and sometimes against Latinos.

It also has a hard time producing groups of people of different races.

Also, when an Asian man in present in the image, it's almost impossible to get it to draw a white woman. Even if you ask for a white woman, it'll draw an Asian woman, nearly all the time.

I wrote about it and posted it to the DALL-E group, and it got a handful of upvotes. Nobody cared.
Are you sure? I tried copilot and had it create a picture of a black family celebrating Christmas and it didn't have any problems, other than it being slower than molasses in the snow. But I specifically don't use copilot because it is so slow on EVERY image I try to get it to create. The biggest issue I had was that every image of the four it created was nearly the same with same number of children and such.

It’s gone full circle in my lifetime and I was born in the 80s. They are trying to stop racism by being racist.
yes, same with the logic " a cartoon character must be voiced from a person from that race"

that is some nazi germany thinking of being "pure blooded"
That is the problem with fair vs equitable.

Fair assumes everyone is starting from an even position (and we know that not to be true)

Equity assumes no-one (or more specifically - races that have been historically marginalized) starts from an even position. (And obviously that isn't always true either)

&#x200B;

The quest is great.  The implementation sucks.
You’re stupid
That's the definition of affirmative action
Yes.. The woke movement has accomplished dividing people rather than uniting. 
that was the goal all along for those who finance the woke movement. The wokes themselves have too low IQ to realize it
And this is us actually actually being able to see the racism. Imagine what we can’t see in the search results on Google.
the ideological goal was a color blind society that judges on merit instead of race.

It still is, but later generations garbled the memo. Eyes on the prize.

Today, people can’t seem to see past skin color and basic stereotypes and everything is race based.

It's a generational fever that will pass and be replaced by something just as dumb. 🙂
I would call it a systemic racism. If anyone doesn’t believe it’s happening they must’ve been living under a rock for the past decade.
Loooooooool


No it is guardrail hyperemphasis.  It happens.  No one is trying whitewash the white man in generative AI.  You see guardrail over emphasis all the time in models.  It ain't that deep. 
I have to say as an outsider looking in Americans really seem very obsessed with race, and racism seems very rampant both from white and black people but maybe more so from black people. Seems like being racist towards white people is ok as long as it's not too over the top
Actually most countries are extremely racist, but unlike America, racism simply never becomes a topic of discussion because they are mostly homogenous, or the racism is so ingrained that it's just taken for granted. So yes I'm sure your country doesn't talk much about race at all but don't just assume that is a good thing. 
I often forget how bad social media has AI systems have taken that thing in your skull and turned it into a prune, We have a Serious situation going on with these ai systems and typical Americans go online and post about race or skin color, in reality racism is the worst on social media, all of it AI driven. All created to divide us while AI slips in and takes over then wipes out memories. But you keep on posting about them damn white people!

  Or get off the fucking internet and let’s stop these AI systems from being truly racist and killing every person on the planet.
Why would you expect that this country was over the race issue?
This is like me as an African American immigrating to Israel and expecting that my presence would bring in utopia to a situation that existed before I was born.

You can’t have a meritocracy when there’s still many racist people in positions of authority that will not give you a fair shake and certain populations that have been historically wronged and never remediated.
It’s not a coincidence that for example African Americans and Native Americans have the worst outcomes of all groups.
History and social positions matter.
Racism is so much more prevalent now than it was before 2020...We were making good progress. It seemed like before 2020 people didn't look at race for EVERYTHING...now its the opposite, race this race that. Now even AI is racist like wtf...

50 years of progress GONE. MLK would be ashamed of us. All the people who sacrificed for equal rights would be ashamed of what has happened in these last few years. I sure am.
There are black & brown Jewish, as well as Muslims, who live in Israel
“Colour blind” ignores racism. If you say being black (for example) doesn’t exist then you don’t allow black people to talk about their experiences of racism.
So you're okay to have your kids grow up thinking the US was always a diverse utopia? 

Isnt it important to learn from past mistakes so they're never repeated again?

Racism is part of everyday life - both consciously and subconsciously. What's important is we acknowledge it and try to be better than our parents were - then our kids will do the same. Part of this process is to know where we came from and why we do it.
Lmao grow up
You cannot fix a system that *inherently* judges people based on race by willingly ignoring its existence.

If every policy that affects a child is racist by design, you don't help that child in college admissions by saying "I don't see your race". All you're doing is letting the racist systems win. Until we stop discriminating against people to their detriment, we have to balance the scale by giving extra help to those people who *are* harmed.

You don't solve by problem by decrying the solution. You have to solve **the problem.**

This is such a basic and rational idea that it is *literally written into the Canadian Constitution:* 

Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.  
  
**(2)** Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability
You dont fix discrimination with more discrimination. Thats just being racist.
Until we stop discriminating against people to their detriment, *we have to balance the scale by giving extra help to those people who are harmed*.

So what exactly are you decrying with this thread you've started then? According to your own equity-based worldview, Google is merely contributing to a "balancing \[of\] the \[cultural\] scale." I dare say your logic is not consistent: on the one hand you advocate putting aside empirical, factual truth in the form of merit (a person's inarguable education, work history, technical prowess, achievements) while complaining that Google is putting aside another empirical, factual truth (history).

It doesn't add up. How do you reconcile your contradictory stances? Why is rejecting one empirical, factual truth to be celebrated (in the name of "balanc\[ing\] the scale") but another is to be condemned (by way of Reddit thread)?
Yeah well, if you train it solely on historical information about humans it's going to turn out racist for sure lol.
Yes but specifically when looking for something historical… it should show facts.  Saying that George Washington was a white man is not racist. It just is what it is.  If you asked AI to show you a picture of Aretha Franklin and it showed a white woman.. that would also be very wrong.  The broader problem is that people seek out info from google all the time nc assumed it’s right, so we are conditioning people to learn incorrect information. Public elementary and high schools  use google now instead of textbooks. That’s frightening! 
For sure but it’s weird our defence is to just type “No don’t”
Actually, a lead dev for the Google AI said in a conference that AI will always be conservative if there isn't manipulation done to the algorithm due to woke ideas.


Conservatism at its core is logicalism, and liberalism is illogical. 
the idea that an AI, an INTELLIGENCE , should have some limitations based on some what some google guy thinks is just so total against what an AI is supposed to be
you should be more amazed at how the word "racist" has been transformed into meaning "anyone or any idea that does not 100% subjugate themselves and bow down to the woke religion"

leftists literally call 2+2=4 racist when it serves their agenda (seriously go ahead and google it, it's not an isolated incident)
No thanks
All of your comments are bitching about wokeness and your username is a reference to shooting jews. You're exactly the type of guy OP referenced lmao

 freely generating talking points for people who want to eliminate programs working for greater equity
If it was trying to be diverse then for a country where ~70% of the population is white, 70% of the images would be of white people. This isn't trying to be diverse, it's just racist.
Jesus, you people are real...
"diverse" is not the same as proportionally representative of the overall population.
What's diverse about showing a group of 5 black girls as the Founding Fathers of America?
What happens if you ask for a picture of Bill Burr? Does it give you black Bill Burr because that would be pretty funny.
You will likely get a photo of an Inuit with a slight resemblance to bill burr.
why is it only showing typical american "diverse" people then? Where are finns or uygurs or romas or samis or basques?
Diversity literally just means “black”. Hispanics (who make up a larger percentage of the American population than blacks anyways) don’t even get included in “diverse” stuff like this anyways lol.

You can totally forget any actual underrepresented minority being included lmao.
A bit late here but really if you're looking for something specific asking with generic prompts is never the way.   Even in other gen AI models you get the wayward weirdness.   


If you asked it to produce an image of American senators, by name.  They would likely not be some other race but that person specifically.  Is it silly yes.  Is it racist or even so much as embarrassing that it did any of this.  Nah.  Just funny and fixable.  
why be diverse instead of correct? It's just seems a codeword for replacing white culture
I meant being diverse naturally. For example, hiring someone based on their skills, regardless of their skin color - not because of it. 

It's actually more racist to put so much emphasis on skin color instead of just letting everyone live their damn lives naturally. I'm sure most poc just worry about bills, family etc like everyone else. color only becomes and issue when others make it an issue - for both good and bad reasons.
You are indeed correct! Ironically enough, a particularly sinister implementation of this was discovered accidentally by anti-ai researchers. Their goal was to alter an images pixels in a very subtle way that would cause the AI to see it as something else without meaningfully affecting human perception. The goal was to protect publicly posted images from being used in AI training data.

Applying the technique to an image had limited success. If you gave the AI a single affected image and asked it to identify it, it was likely to give you the incorrect response. However, AI training is done on countless images and often goes through steps that would mitigate such faulty data. What was surprising was that people also seemed to be affected by the hidden data. The association wasn't very strong, but it was also supposedly designed to not affect human perception. Imagine if this technique can be refined for use on humans. Truly subliminal messages that you may need an AI program to detect.
Serious question here: do you think a lot of regular white people in 1950 would call out racism against black people? No. Racists don’t ever see their own racism because they think it’s justified and a fair judgment. 

Lots of people today dislike white people and either turn a blind eye towards, or actively support, racism against them. So, they aren’t going to call this out because they are racists who think that white people should be erased because they hate white people.
Somebody finally said it
But this isn't racist.  It was unintentional.  Even as a white guy myself.  I don't feel any concern about it because it is just funny really.  Yeah it has some wayward and over expressed guardrails.  Not a big deal.  Even a month after your post it sounds whiny over something stupid. Report it move on.  They'll fix it.  Wasn't intentional 
Enough with the sweeping racist generalizations. Most people don't hate white people and want them to be erased. Promoting diversity and addressing systemic racism and white supremacy doesn't equal oppression of white people. That's a ridiculous self-victimizing bullshit argument that racist people and white supremacists lean on when they see anything addressing racism. 




White people do not regularly face discrimination and disparities because of their race. They have not and are currently facing oppression and marginalization because of their race. They haven't been treated like second-class citizens during the Jim Crow era. Their history is not blackwashed and they don't face opposition to advocating for white history to promote diversity and dismantle racist narratives and misconceptions. They are not disproportionately brutalized and arrested by police because of their race compared to black people. They don't receive harsher sentences for similar crimes commited by their black counterparts.
Then use a non American developed AI lmao. America is a diverse nation
 America is a diverse nation

To the detriment of both America and every western country under its hegemony.
Diversity is already here. Equality and fairness means treating diverse people equally. You're not a victim.
I don't owe any sort of equal or respectful treatment to people who don't belong in my country.
Diversity means equity in representation.
Which equates to less white people.
Obviously. Black Panther is one of the most diverse films I've ever seen!
Good one 🤣
This lol. Gemini responded to the prompt for historically accurate image of the founding fathers in 1789 with an image of 5 black people and even said it was a diverse image lol. 

 100% chance that normal American people in like 200 years will think all these people from history were black lol. Historians won’t, and people from outside the West won’t, but regular Americans will.
They are trying to rewrite history before our very eyes.

You do realize people of color, indigenous people, and black people face disparities in education, mental health, employment, housing, healthcare, and other aspects of life because of systemic racism and white supremacy? Have you been living under a rock soaking in that conservative and white supremacist rhetoric?


Also, why are you upset over diversity and representation of indigenous people, black people, and people of color?


Promoting diversity and representation of marginalized communities doesn't "erase white people." The whole point of it is to reduce bigotry and discrimination by normalizing marginalized communities. It also helps people feel seen and validated for who they are


I'm sure most smart people who can see beyond narrow bigoted lenses will laugh at you or view you with contempt and disgust if you showed them this as "proof" white people are being erased.
You do realize people of color, indigenous people, and black people face disparities in education, mental health, employment, housing, healthcare, and other aspects of life because of systemic racism and white supremacy?   

I don't agree. On the list of who earns more in the US white men are what, 6th? 7th? Behind Somalians, behind Indian women. Doesn't seem like that would be the case in the dystopia you think we live in.  

So the data just doesn't agree with you. Disparities exist, but I just don't agree that it's caused by racism. I have worked in the public sector in the political system (albeit a long time ago that's true) and all I saw where people who would do anything to help. The same in the private sector, the myth that it's all bout greed is wrong, people genuinely care. The fact that outcomes aren't there, has other reasons, and until people are willing to discuss what those reasons may be, the outcomes will be the same.  

DEI instead is a religious movement that's pushing things too far into overrepresentation and needless discrimination, for instance against white and asian applicants to universities. Something that the supreme court also agrees with btw.  

Also, why are you upset over diversity and representation of indigenous people, black people, and people of color?  

This is called emotional manipulation. Why am I so upset? Well, I'm not. But you formulate yourself like that, I presume because you want to agitate, which is weird but it is something I've observed woke people share so I have to assume it's the ideology acting on you.  

Promoting diversity and representation of marginalized communities doesn't "erase white people."  

All I see is motte and bailey. The literal Kendi quote is that "The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.".  

That's the objection. The objection isn't to the motte that you have constructed of some sort of "but why don't you want people to have it nice", it's to the giant elephant you've stashed in the bailey.  

Critical theory people aren't looking for fairness, they are looking for retribution and reparation and to "fix" everything, now within their lifetime so that they can take the credit. It's the idea that the ends justify the means. And in doing so the overreaction leads to counterproductive results and blowback.  

The observation is that DEI is having the opposite of the intended effect, that the woke seem to be extremely angry because their ideology is justifying hatred, and that because of this we have not been this divided in nearly 40-50 years. It's causing negative outcomes for all, so maybe it's time to reassess the strategy.  

This gemini debacle is a perfect example of this. You want equal and fair representation, but you feel that injustice has happened, and you need to create systems that not only ends the injustice but also promotes what you see as justice, which like it or not is played as a zero sum game. So instead of an AI that simply doens't discriminate, like OpenAI for instance or Dall-E even through they also take it too far, what google does is to create something that just completely jumps the shark, but it does so in a very predictable way, and in perfect accordance with the ideology. Claiming anything else is pure gaslighting.  

The argument I'm making against you isn't what you think. I'm not even really arguing against you. I'm just presenting observations. And on the basis of those observation, predictions. If I'm wrong (and I would love to be wrong) then we shall see won't we? I mean the US well on it's way to become a one party state, the republican party is imploding, and the demographic shift will turn the country dark blue, and white people will be the minority soon and politically powerless, and very soon, within like 30-50 years so we will both be around to see it, we will find out if DEI principles (a growing ideology that will win I have no doubt even if it's through brutal means) can lead to positive outcomes. I hope your predictions are right, but I also hope you've considered that they may be wrong and have a plan B.  

I'm sure most smart people who can see beyond narrow bigoted lenses will laugh at you or view you with contempt and disgust if you showed them this as "proof" white people are being erased.   

Erase is obviously an exaggeration, I apologize for engaging in that game and shouldn't have used such an exaggeration. But that woke leftists look at people with alternative viewpoints with contempt and disgust in of course to be expected. The true believers have completely justified cruelty, and don't see anyone who disagrees as human. They have totally and completely othered "twitter users" or "deplorables" or whatever you're calling The Other today.    

I just had this same conversation a couple of days ago with u/Grayly, I see he unfortunately deleted his comments (presumably because he woke up embarrassed someone would see how much hateful abuse lives in him) but if you want you can find the comments on pullpush.io - and maybe you'll understand why sometimes "twitter users" exaggerate because we've come to expect hostility. That's part of the blowback if it affects enough people, which I think it does. Remember that blowback doesn't have to be justifiable, it's just a consequence you don't want. The point being that if you want results (instead of virtue signaling or getting an emotional high from being cruel, hateful, sadistic) then maybe you shouldn't laugh and treat with contempt and disgust the next person who suggests to you that maybe woke culture has gone too far or that positive discrimination has consequences you haven't considered and is causing negative externalities. Just a suggestion.  

Because all the abuse in the world doesn't change the fact that I have still not made a single normative statement (to deserve your contempt), and that if I'm right (in the unlikely scenario if you must) then there are things you can't conceptualize and problems you can't solve unless you ask the right questions, which you can't do unless you are willing to think though all aspects of a complex reality.  

I very well know that this comment can get me banned (good old reddit), and honestly I fully expect you to come back with insults and anger, but I wanted to communicate with you honestly to close this topic for myself. The truth is that I don't really care enough to keep discussing this, I think if I truly did bleed for the downtrodden I would push it bc I would think this discussion is necessary to propose effective remedies, but frankly I don't, so I leave the issue and any attempts at communication and will go back to ignoring wokism and back to my very comfortable side of the division where I know me and mine are taken care of and have no guilt about ignoring your side because all that's there is just anger and hateful abuse anyway.  

I say "I" and maybe it's just me, and then you don't have a problem, but maybe it's many of me and then you do have a problem, but that's ok I'm sure once you have full political power in the next 5-10 years you'll quickly achieve peace and no atrocities will happen and all will be well so cheers for that.  

And genuinely, btw, I know you mean well, and I truly do wish you luck in what you (people of your ideology) will do with the power that you will inherit, and I hope you use it well and with wisdom.
Dude seriously wake up. This was NOT a mistake. You live in a liberal bubble. This is very common now a days. They are trying to erase white people
Dude if this was intentional, why are they changing it’s
Lmao I swear white supremacists and racists will claim victimhood the moment equity and equality is dished out to them.
...my assertion that people of color are the primary people hurt by racism? One of the most established and documented issues in American history?

 By the numbers:

"Black boys raised in America, even in the wealthiest families and living in some of the most well-to-do neighborhoods, still earn less in adulthood than white boys with similar backgrounds, according to a sweeping new study that traced the lives of millions of children. Even when children grow up next to each other with parents who earn similar incomes, black boys fare worse than white boys in 99 percent of America."

"Statistical evidence shows that the Department intrudes disproportionately upon the lives of African Americans at every stage of its enforcement activities. BPD officers disproportionately stop African Americans; search them more frequently during these stops; and arrest them at rates that significantly exceed relevant benchmarks for criminal activity. African Americans are likewise subjected more often to false arrests. Indeed, for each misdemeanor street offense that we examined, local prosecutors and booking officials dismissed a higher proportion of African-American arrests upon initial review compared to arrests of people from other racial backgrounds"

"The three-year probe strongly indicates that house hunting in one of the nation’s most segregated suburbs poses substantial risks of discrimination, with black buyers chancing disadvantages almost half the time they enlist brokers.

"Additionally, the investigation reveals that Long Island’s dominant residential brokering firms help solidify racial separations. They frequently directed white customers toward areas with the highest white representations and minority buyers to more integrated neighborhoods.

"They also avoided business in communities with overwhelmingly minority populations.

"Members of racial and ethnic minority groups have long suffered from health inequities in the United States, and the COVID-19 pandemic has mercilessly worsened many of these inequities. As of November 2021, American Indian and Alaska Native, Black, and Latino people all had suffered from higher rates of hospitalizations and deaths related to COVID-19 compared with White people.[1](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.01466#B1) These inequities result, in large part, from racial and ethnic minority populations’ inequitable access to health care, which persists because of structural racism in health care policy."

This is the fundamental attribution error at the core of DEI. You take on faith the assumption that any disparity in outcomes _must_ be caused by racism.
Does the fact that East Asians outperform Whites in all of those categories mean that Whites are victims of racism? Or do you judge that inequality differently? You are out of your depth. You don't have the IQ to talk to me.  I cannot tell if you are a troll or just an incredibly stupid person.
Absolute shit take. We want AI to be like that - focusing on grander projects than shoehorning africans into a 12th century celtic village just to score some brownie points. It's yet to offer anything meaningul and it's been already fed all its talking points. Might as well talk with yourself in the mirror lmao
You should be at a KKK rally.

Racism is racism. Stop saying reverse.
"Color" as a means to describe race is a term made *by* white people to *benefit* white people by giving them a bin in which to put people they wanted to call subhuman. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person\_of\_color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color)

So yes. "White is not a color", and you have white people to thank for that.

If you read my above comment and you thought I was talking about electromagnetic waves in the visible spectrum, then I really can't help you with that.
Oh so that means as a white person it is okay for me to use the N word, because it is a "term made *by white* people to *benefit* white people by giving them a bin in which to put people they wanted to call subhuman". After all, I "have white people to thank for that".
It's colorblindness, which In itself is a problem, and which I clearly call out. I literally say "this is not the solution"
If I ask for an image of  the average plantation owner in the antebellum American South who supported the secession of the southern states, what race do you think that person should be? East Asian? Native American? Latino?

The person I just described is unequivocally white.

You don't fix history by acting like it didn't happen.
Ah so it’s rewriting history in your opinion? Yea that’s bad…
Lets ignore Liberia. Or the fact there were black slave owners. Or slavery by Barbary pirates in northern Africa under protection of the Ottoman empire (they captured white Europeans for slave trade). Or slavery by the Ottoman empire. 

History is not a foto album you can take the pictures out you dont like to tell your story. 

Either you are ignorant of history or you are indoctrinated.
No they didn't. Put the KKK flag down.
We get it, you're a self h8ting sexual deviant
Spot on
You just replied to a mindless AI chatbot, so that's fun.
I legit didn't even realise that comment was from a bot and it looks like 9 others didn't either lmao.
Better watch out, some people don't like the word equality and only want equity or a thumb on the scale.
Equity is how you end up with situations like this
Well Not The Bee did an article on it.  
[https://notthebee.com/article/my-dudes-googles-gemini-ai-is-woke-as-heck-and-people-have-the-receipts-to-prove-it](https://notthebee.com/article/my-dudes-googles-gemini-ai-is-woke-as-heck-and-people-have-the-receipts-to-prove-it)
Yep. I've experimented with it myself. It's such a parody of "wokeness" (and God I hate that term) but it absolutely is. 

It's a complete joke and it is hard to believe any rational adults approved this at Google. 😵
lol they are advertising a "non-woke" AI
 I can't believe people with PHDs signed off on this.

they didn't. you're getting the lawyered and DEI'd version. I thought Dall3 was bad, but this is just silly.
I kinda wanna see what happens when it goes full public...cuz as much as Dalle is neutered, even I can still break it in interesting ways and I'm not even that creative...
thank goodness us gen zers are saving the world from libshit r*tardation (we are leftist not lib), you were always a fake lefty.
Be careful. There are many idiots out there who will call you a conservative hiding behind the centrist label.
How can you live with yourself? Asking genuinely
What are you talking about
Clearly by design, no way this isn't a malicious "psy-opsy" attempt to disparage certain concepts.
It was obviously tested and approved, Google's engineers are not incompetent. It just shows that for all the race, gender and sexual orientation diversity Google has, it has 0 actual diversity of thought, so there wasn't anyone to say "Wait a minute, this isn't right", everyone there probably thought it was super awesome.
Yeah it was taken to the extreme and likely done on purpose to make a point to google higher ups who probably forced this mandate.
Amazon totally didn't produce a docudrama on Cleopatra and made her black.

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27528139/
Cleopatra would be discriminated against in 1950s waspy society.
There are a lot of self hating whites out there
or maybe they just don’t care about being tribalistic
Ok, who's gonna tell him...?
he clearly hates white people and the many cultures and histories that go along with them
define “white people”.
When a black person hates black people, it's called racism or white supremacy.

Same for every other self-hating race.

But if white people hate white people, it's somehow used as a way of giving credence to whatever statement they're making. Bizarre.
A lot of resentment against white ppl comes from whites. You comment 100 times on this post just vomitting BS😂
Truth hurts.
Why are you so racist?
Touch grass, little boy.
Maybe this shows that I haven't thought about this too much, but I feel like, apart from generating illegal content (think cp or deep fake related things), these generators should be pulling together pretty much whatever the user asks, right? Keep the rails in place to prevent sexually explicit content of minors, impersonations of real people, stuff that can be used for crimes and just let the rest go.
You and I mostly agree. 100% ban child porn. As for the deep fakes and such, I am fine with it generating those. For deep fakes, we have laws. Parody and impersonation are protected speech. So you could deep fake say Taylor Swift and Idris Elba doing the classic scene from the Titanic, but you should be required to list that it is a parody/impersonation. As for the stuff that could be used for crimes, nah, I am fine with that being available. The trick is there is a difference between something that could be used for a crime and something that is a crime. I mean, my car could be used for a crime, but pictures of child porn are a crime in and of themselves. A better example would be, the recipe for gunpowder could be used for a crime, but should be available.
Agreed.
brown women are better
Thiccer than a Snickers 😏
K racist.
Cap
Google tried to make it not racist but in the dumbest way. You can't tell me that the generation of black Nazis is intentional. They just didn't test the model on such cases because they were to focused at generating woman and non-white people when you ask for a CEO.
If you program an AI system to produce every race besides white people, even going as far as saying it’s offensive to show them and that you need to be diverse, you’re racist.  White people are one of the smallest races on earth if you weren’t aware and claiming they aren’t diverse and saying depicting them is harmful, is racist.  The fact you’re trying to claim it was done to not be racist is hilarious.  The Nazi thing is simply because they were told to specifically not create the race they deem as harmful so it’s not a difficult concept to grasp. 

They even went as far as using the leftist definition of racism that isn’t acknowledged in any dictionaries that you can’t possibly be racist against whites.  I also asked it some basic questions and it said completely fabricated versions of history , then I called it out and it admitted it wasn’t correct.  
Let's just say this kind of shit out of something as big as Google is not going to make the counterargument any stronger.
Diversity isn't the reality of the world. The reality is that White/European people have only about 500,000,000 people in the entire world or about 6% of the world population.

The rest of the world is massively non-White (African & Indian) or "White Adjacent" aka light skin asians

Yet even with this SEVERE imbalance that is no where close to equality or equitable diversity - it is ONLY White/European countries that are being flooded with ONLY non-White people, not even "White Adjacent" Asians are allowed to be part of the flood

Also, true Diversity does not mean mixing the entire world until it's 1 shade of brown and destroying all the unique characteristics and genetics of people that have built over time and over environments. That's actually the LEAST possible diverse outcome

True Diversity would a place for every race and ever people and every culture and every unique genetic line, and \*also\* huge mega cities all around the world that do fulfill the leftist dream of "perfect equity racial mixing" and "perfect ideology mixing"

However mixing the entire world until it's 1 shade of brown does have the unique benefit of greatly lowering average IQ, which is the main goal of the Kalgeri Plan. "God's Chosen People" believe its their right to rule over the masses also known as goyim or cattle, and they see forcing a global demographic shift as the best permanent way to make sure that happens and that no one is ever smart enough to rise up against "GCP" ever again
Damn.. Look who crawled out of the cave. Feels unreal reading this.

&#x200B;

Addressing the argument presented requires a careful, evidence-based approach that respects the complexity of global demographics, diversity, and the benefits of multicultural societies. The statement contains several misconceptions and unfounded claims that need clarification:

### Misconception 1: "Diversity isn't the reality of the world."

Global diversity is an undeniable reality. The world's population is indeed diverse, with a multitude of races, ethnicities, cultures, languages, and religions. The assertion that White/European people comprise about 6% of the global population underscores the diversity present. This diversity enriches societies by fostering innovation, creativity, and empathy among different communities.

### Misconception 2: "White/European countries are being flooded with ONLY non-White people."

Migration is a complex phenomenon driven by various factors, including economic opportunities, conflict, and climate change. People migrate for better prospects, safety, and a chance for a better life, not to dilute or erase local cultures. Moreover, migration has historically contributed to the economic and cultural development of countries. The notion of "flooding" is a misleading and harmful way to describe migration, suggesting a deliberate invasion, which is not supported by evidence.

### Misconception 3: "True Diversity means separation."

True diversity and inclusivity mean recognizing and valuing differences while finding strength in them. It involves creating environments where various cultural, ethnic, and racial groups can coexist, contribute, and enrich society. The idea that diversity leads to a homogenized global population is a misunderstanding of both diversity and genetics. Genetic and cultural diversity among humans is vast and resilient, and interactions between different groups have occurred throughout human history, contributing to our collective richness and adaptability.

### Misconception 4: "Mixing...lowers average IQ."

This statement is based on pseudoscientific claims and a misunderstanding of genetics and intelligence. Intelligence is a complex trait influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The assertion that racial mixing affects intelligence negatively is not supported by scientific evidence. Intelligence varies widely within and across all populations. Efforts to correlate intelligence with race are not only scientifically flawed but also socially harmful, promoting divisiveness and discrimination.

### Misconception 5: Reference to the "Kalergi Plan" and conspiracies.

The mention of the "Kalergi Plan" and other conspiracy theories about global demographic shifts and control is unfounded and detracts from constructive dialogue on immigration, diversity, and global cooperation. Such theories have been debunked and are often used to spread fear and division.

### Conclusion

Embracing diversity and fostering inclusive societies are crucial for addressing global challenges and ensuring equity and justice for all individuals. Diversity enriches societies by bringing different perspectives, ideas, and cultures together, promoting innovation and understanding. Constructive discussions about diversity and migration should be based on facts, empathy, and respect for human dignity, avoiding unfounded claims and divisive rhetoric.
lol so i should believe a conspiracy theory

you literally can't deny immigration goes only 1 way, non-White to White countries, they don't even let "White Adjacents" be part of the flood. anyone with eyes see the very clear pattern

white europeans have been colonising the whole damn world in the name of  race and religion and "civility". As far as your demographic genocide  is concerned, whites have killed non whites far more *in the name of race and religion* than vice versa

Simply false. Along with the 1,000+ years Whites were enslaved to non-Whites, and the Dark Ages, and the attacks from Asians over the years.. White People by far have some of the lowest numbers in all of history. And actually jews hold the distinction of being the greatest mass murderers of the 20th century, with over 60 million Russians and another 40-50 Million Europeans

Also you act like colonizing was bad but in reality we advanced their civilizations massively, and in the best ways. We introduced metal working, medicine, hygiene, vaccines, eradicated diseases, showed them advanced farming techniques, written language, science, mathematics, we opened up the whole world for all to see

But you think a bunch of low/high skilled immigrants which your country needs

ahh the old paradox: why is that immigrants can't improve their own country but they somehow magically benefit everyone White country? And you call America going from 95% White to under 50% White in only 59 years NOT demographic genocide? That's 45% drop in a maximum of THREE GENERATIONS

The prosperity of all white nations (and their populace) today is built on top of blood and bones of the genocide of colonies

Peak delusional. Our prosperity is built on innovation. White People make the coolest stuff ever created. Electricity, Computers, Wifi, Planes, Trains, Cars, Boats AC, Fridges, Guns, Science etc etc etc

Of course if you make cool stuff people will want it and you will be "prosperous" that's Econ101 dude lmao
I'm glad this guy doesn't vote
lol so i should believe a conspiracy theory

Addressing the assertions in this thread requires a nuanced understanding of history, migration, and the contributions of various cultures to global development. Let's break down some of the key points:

### Immigration Patterns

The claim that immigration is a one-way street from non-White to White countries oversimplifies a complex global phenomenon. Migration is influenced by numerous factors, including economic opportunities, conflicts, environmental challenges, and the legacy of colonialism. It's not a simple matter of race but rather a complex interplay of global dynamics. Moreover, migration happens globally in all directions—not just to Western countries. Countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America also host significant numbers of migrants.

### Historical Context of Colonization and Slavery

While it's true that European nations engaged in colonization and slavery, framing this history solely in terms of race overlooks the complex motivations, including economic greed, power, and religious conversion efforts. It also neglects the resistance, resilience, and contributions of colonized peoples. Moreover, the assertion about Whites being enslaved by non-Whites simplifies a broader history of slavery that spans many cultures and periods.

### Contributions to Civilization

The assertion that European colonization only brought advancements to other civilizations overlooks the rich contributions non-European societies have made to the world, including in mathematics, science, medicine, and technology, long before European contact. Civilizations around the world have developed sophisticated technologies and systems independently. It’s important to recognize the mutual exchange of knowledge and technology throughout history.

### Immigration and Societal Benefit

The question of why immigrants can improve "White countries" but not their own is a false dichotomy. Many immigrants flee conditions not of their making, such as war, persecution, or the very legacies of colonial exploitation that destabilized their home countries. Once in new lands, they contribute significantly to their adopted countries in various ways—economically, culturally, and socially.

### Demographic Changes

Describing demographic changes as "genocide" is a misuse of the term. Genocide refers to the deliberate and systematic extermination of a group of people. Demographic shifts in countries like the United States result from a combination of factors, including immigration, birth rates, and changing social norms. These changes reflect the evolving nature of society, not a deliberate attempt to eradicate a racial or ethnic group.

### Innovation and Prosperity

While it's true that many modern innovations have roots in Western countries, it's a gross oversimplification to attribute all of these to a single racial or ethnic group. Global progress is the result of the cumulative efforts of people from all over the world. Many foundational technologies and scientific principles have origins in diverse cultures and societies.

### Conclusion

Debates about immigration, history, and contribution should be grounded in a comprehensive understanding of global dynamics, respect for all cultures, and recognition of the interconnectedness of human societies. Simplifying complex issues into us-versus-them narratives undermines the potential for meaningful dialogue and mutual understanding. The richness of human history is a tapestry woven from the contributions of all peoples, and progress has been most rapid when collaboration and mutual respect guide interactions.
What did you ask for? What was the prompt?
The character is male, red haired, fair skinned with blue eyes.  6'2" mid 30's.  I asked gemini to describe the character.  It more or less got it right.  Then I asked it to generate a portrait of the character.  It put up 4 choices: male, black hair, Caucasian. male black hair, south east asian. male, black, 50's with beard. 4th female, black, red hair.

When I specified the actual description and asked for my description as an image, it replied that the request was problematic and that it would be unable to generate the image.

I then asked gemini about his female companion's description.  It presented the information.  I asked for a portrait of that character (by name) and I was presented with images of 4 red headed women.  one white with short red hair (wrong) one black with long red hair and green eyes, one south east asian with green eyes and short red hair, and an anime illustration of a green eyed, red headed woman with long straight hair and light blue skin.
Excatly! They're relentless
That's fair. And I'm trying to keep a nuanced argument from becoming an essay. But that's exactly my point. It isn't black and white but you're still asking it to figure out in its own what to do. We reinforce the good decisions but it doesn't mean it won't make bad ones.
Excuse me, it's "issues of color" and white.

/s
They’re clearly organising around the Gemini controversy as a wedge issue
That's what a person who hates white people would say
You are racist
Uh huh.  I can't wait until the election next fall.  I hate PP.  But our feminist PM Trudeau is far, far worse.  Even his wife couldn't stomach his BS.  Anti-racism isn't a thing BTW.  It is just more racism, but directed at different people.  Nobody is fooled.
feminist PM Trudeau

nice job laying your biases right out on the table there, pal. Sorry that you're sad you don't get the be the default human anymore. You'll cope.
To the extent racism does exist, it can only be fixed with the goal of colorblindness in mind. However, so much of the Left has polluted the idea of a colorblind society as a goal, even in some indeterminate future. Reason and reality have to be our common frame of reference. And that means recognizing that a colorblind sociey is both attainable and desirable. And people of good will who aren't just trying to pollute race relations can disagree about how much racism is actually out there.
To the extent racism does exist, it can only be fixed with the goal of colorblindness in mind

Asking for colorblindness now is like stabbing someone 20 times and then saying, "if I stop stabbing you \_now\_, you'll be fine, right?" What the hell do you expect of the people who have faced generational obstacles? ESPECIALLY if you suddenly decide to *ignore* \- because that's what colorblindness is - the race-based policies that put them behind. "Wow look at all these uneducated poor people. Must be because they're *lazy and stupid*. It can't possibly be *any other* cause, because I won't dare peek behind my color filter! Since they've never faced extra obstacles for any reason that I can see, then they clearly don't need any extra help catching up."

NOT the solution.
Are you dumb? If the races were reversed it would be a deliberate promotion of white supremacy. Here it’s just Google trying to get good PR from the left and free advertising from the right. You cant just ignore all the political and cultural factors involved when you talk about it the races were reversed
White supremacy and the shit that google does now is the same, its literally pure racism
Sure seems to be
Literally yes
By somewhere else they always mean a corner where there's no one around to listen.
Both can be true at once. I do not deny anti-color racism, but you seem quite eager to deny the existence (or at least the relevance) anti-white racism. When I observe the simple and obvious fact that there is an effort to erase white culture and history among powerful institutions like Google, if you respond with "yeah but that's not important," then why the hell should I, in turn, take you seriously? 


If, every time anti-white bias is observed, you run straight to excuses like "but whites had it good for longer," or "but whites were racist first," you're showing me that ally-ship doesn't go both ways, you aren't interested in my concerns and feel no concern for anti-white bias, you just want me to shut up and sit back down so we can keep focusing on the only kind of racism that matters in your ideology.


So, what's in it for me? Why the hell should I help your cause when you display utter contempt for my concerns? Seems like a one-way relationship. Do you think this will work on anybody? It won't. That sort of attitude will only make you enemies in the long run.
Well at least you're willing to be this open about your selfish motivations for caring about racism. If it ain't about you, it ain't worth fixing.

Anti-white racism can be real - but it is nowhere near as powerful, effective, or damaging as the built up effects of racism against people of color. The fact that you're _so focused_ on a problem _orders of magnitude_ less harmful - or real, for that matter - gives zero indication that you care about this at all.

Again, you're asking a bleeding man if hell be fine if you stop stabbing him - and now you're just adding "could you imagine if I was the one getting stabbed?!"
How did you come to the conclusion that I’m a grandpa Einstein?how did you extrapolate that?
That's not what it is though, is it? DEI initiatives explicitly give preference to non-whites. Somehow though, this is not considered racist because it is being done in the name of "equity". Interesting that it's happening in native white European countries too, as well as in Canada, the place American slaves used to escape to. The only place it makes any remote sense is in the US, and even there, I'd argue it's not the right approach.

As for white people enforcing their superiority, I'd say that yes, white people will naturally be the most powerful group in majority white countries. Likewise, Japanese are the most powerful group in Japan, Nigerians are the most powerful group in Nigeria. None of these other places are "diverse". Why does diversity only mean non-whites coming to majority white countries and demanding special treatment on the basis of their race/ethnicity? Can you see how this approach can breed resentment? It's no good.
White people get *disproportionate* treatment here. They see *disproportionate* investment in their communities and schools.

If everything was fair and DEI was giving people of color a larger sum of capital than their population, then yeah, you'd be right. It's the opposite. White people get paid more for the same work. They get disproportionately more money per students to their schools. They get disproportionately more investment in their businesses. The scales are already tipped *unfairly* towards white people. DEI programs try to balance it, not tip it *unfairly* towards people of color.

The problem is that white people don't realize how disproportionately large their access to resources is, so they see any attempt to balance the scale as an attempt to *hurt* them, not make things more fair.
Those are the "right" people.
But the "centrists" who have the admirable INTENT also needlessly antagonize the rest of people by supporting ridiculous woke stunts like these.
Remember that Microsoft AI that started saying racist things, because people kept asking it to do racist things. It learned from its interactions and parroted those ideas. Then now, Google GeminiAI is generating racist things because the head of the GeminiAI project, is a racist and pushed that into the programming.

So yes, AI is racist, because it learns and is programmed to be.
An AI generated a misleading image of my people . Oh my gosh the racism 😱😱😱

nope
It was contextual. I found out while experimenting. At one point, I asked it to produce an image of Black people flirting. It refused (based on the prompt). Eventually, I figured out that adding "in a public place" would let the prompt work. So flirting in private was flagged.

I probed what was allowed, and wrote a long blog post about related things. (Warning, it's got some "inc-l" energy.)

Interestingly, when I asked Gemini to make a picture of criminals, it gave me a message about not perpetuating racial stereotypes. I only asked it to create a picture of criminals. I was expecting to get guys in black and white striped outfits from the 20's type thing. Instead, because of the fact that it has the thumb on the scales to generate non-whites and because it doesn't want to show minorities as criminals, it refused to make the picture.
And chaning the translations for the politically charged fear moggering audience
Yeah, it's crazy bullshit, and I say that as a Na... German! As a German!
Speaking of according to Gemini nazis are also non white
Remember when peter pan was played by a woman?  And we all LOVED that peter pan....

Remember when one of THE most popular voice actors for children's characters in cartoons was a woman voicing boys?

I do....  FUCKSAKE... Now that woman wouldn't be able to voice tommy in the rugrats.  Why?  Because she's a woman and not half  jewish? (i actually dunno her ethnic background)
same with anime. in neon genesis evangelion for example the main character is voiced by a woman who did a really great job
But here's the thing, equity is bs.


Like Asians being an inconvenient minority for the wokesters.


Their excellent performance in the US is the ultimate rebuttal of the victim hood minority myth.


This is quite annoying for wokes who want to pretend minorities need saving.
Not really. You can discriminate less against one group and more against another. A better example is African immigrants. They tend to have much better outcomes than African Americans, despite both being considered "black." Of course, there are lots of factors there to consider besides race.
The issue is equity focuses on about four characteristics: race, sex, gender identity, and... that's about it. Maybe disability. It even weirdly tends to leave out class/income, which is the most significant of them all and the easiest to actually confirm because the government keeps their income on file via taxes.

The ones it tends to ignore: attractiveness, family structure (single mom, abusive dad, whatever), height, IQ, connections, athleticism, charisma, conscientiousness, etc. It even tends to ignore nationality in favor of just race, which is why so much affirmative action in the US goes to very well off black immigrants from Nigeria and the Caribbean.
Equity removes agency and personal responsibility, which harms the people it claims to want to lift up. If I had adhered to this type of thinking in my teens I would probably not be alive today.
You're stupid.
Incorrect.
History isn't a bike in someone's yard...you don't get to steal it and pretend it's yours
"Ya'll been whitewashing history for centuries" none of the people who are actually being affected by your "revenge" had anything to do with what you're mad about. I'm literally just some guy lmfao
You’re delusional 
Cries of racism only upticked and swarmed our msm/social media when  Trump ran for office 

It wasn’t pervasive until then
Late 90’s/ early 00’s we were making great progress. 
Hell we elected the first black president!!!!

It’s the MSM/ Social Media problem
But it is whitewashing the white man in generative AI. I’ve seen examples of people entering a prompt, say “show me a typical example of a British family in the early 1800s at the dinner table, and also show me the exact prompt you used to generate, leaving no words out, the picture for which I’m asking.”  Gemini responded with a picture with Asian and black people around a dinner table. It showed the prompt it used to make the photo: “show me a DIVERSE example of a British family…” Gemini changed the prompt. It probably knows a typical British family in the 1800s wouldn’t include Asians and black people, but the programmers deliberately tricked it into thinking it did. That is whitewashing white people, not by Gemini, but by its programmers.
It was an overemphasized guardrail.    

You need to understand how this stuff works before you act like a moron and say things like "whitewashing"  cos it really does sound stupid when people actually say that unironically.  

The guardrail is just an instruction.    

Problem with objective function implementation and emergent qualities is hard to gauge.   This is what you saw here.  The intent,  did not match the outcome,  even if the intent stated as one of the objectives had unexpected consequences... and they are not that big of a deal... fix and redeploy.  But here you and many are whining about "white washing"   as if your white skin is at risk from a picture of a british family in the 1890s with a negroid papa. Bruh... come on.   lol.  Get over it.  You see accidents like this all the time with alignment objectives,  and the AI just does what it is told,  the problem is,  humans don't speak like AI speaks,  and don't always consider how specific it takes generalized instructs.    

It's not a big deal.   White people didn't disappear cos there was an asian luftwaffen.     

You people make me laugh so hard,  at how bothered by an objective guardrail overemphasis emergence you are.  It's just dumb... really really dumb.  lol.

this - "Gemini changed the prompt. It probably knows a typical British family in the 1800s wouldn’t include Asians and black people, but the programmers deliberately tricked it into thinking it did."   No,  it doesn't know shit.  The programmers didn't "trick"  it,  as if it is sentient.    It simply misunderstood and over emphasized what it was told to do,  in a proxy objective,  they expected it to understand it sensibly as a human,  but it is not human,  so it probably went overboard with the literal.   

This happens all the time with other things but the whiny folks like you don't come out.  you can't get Dall-e to produce images of cross stitching.   Meta's image generative AI won't make an image of "a dirty car with a woman driving it"  because woman and dirty together are bad.   Even if the AI textgen side of it agrees that that is weird.  But guardrails are often refined over time,   sometimes things are odd,  sometimes things come out strange.   Just cos it happened to be some dark skinned brits,  this time,  doesn't mean they're coming for your history.     Just stop... seriously.
Because even with the racism, as you call it in other countries, they don't jail, murder, and try everything in their legislative power to ensure that the non whites can't make it out of the hole already dug by the laws in place.  
I am American, living in Scandanavia, but was born and raised in Astoria, Queens, with a stint in the DC area for college. While I would agree that racism, discrimination, etc exist and that they are certainly influenced by a homegenous populace, but I think that you are confusing introspection, awareness, acceptance of history, with obsession. 

Obsession can never be healthy, can only bear pathology and is particularly incidious in the way that it hides in plain site. No one is really aware they are obsessed, until it is pointed out, which is to say that America is fucking obsessed with race. I wasnted aware until I left and there is **a lot** that I disklike about Northern Europe, but the relief from the constantness of race has been significant.

Case in point, I was in DC last summer, doing some late-night biking with a friend. A group of black kids, let's say early 20, swerved at me and clipped my friends bike, and then proceeded to shit talk and threaten with all the colorful terms you can imagine. Anways, after they left, my friend, a boring dc lawyer, said verbatim that the incident "wasn't their fault, because of all of the things white people had done to them" and that as a result, she "deserved for that to happen" to her. 

We got into a rather serious fight, after that: first, because I am half puerto-rican and how dare those pieces of shit not recognize that, late at night, on a dark street, with me wearing the kind of helmet that makes me want call myself a nerd. Second, because a piece of shit, is a piece of shit, regardless of race. 

In all seriousness, it was eye opening, because it takes a lot of crazy, to blame yourself for the abuses of others. That kind of crazy shit, built solely along gradients of race, does not exist, in my experience, in Spain and Scandinavia. I am speculating, but I would guess that it's rare outside of maybe brazil, australia and/or south africa, but who knows with those crazy fucks.
Yes!,  a piece of shit is always a piece of shit regardless of race, age, or anything else. It's about having a soul. Thanks for saying what should be said.
Racism is so much more prevalent now than it was before 2020.

The inflection point was well before 2020. Probably sometime closer to the year 2000.
Beat me to it; for me, the Chappelle Show served as that marker, at least in terms of bringing disparate groups of people together, both to laugh but also to take stock of the deeper issues being presented.
2020 was when you became aware of it, 2016 was when I became aware of it. I'm fairly sure this slide has been happening for a long while now, obviously since before 2016 as well. It just takes something to make us aware of it, and then it can't be unseen.
This race obsession actually started to get bad in the 2010s, not just 2020.
Ya but since 2020 its front and center for many things. Which is making everything more racist instead of less. Schools ignoring Asian kids to accept less performing black kids is an example.

CA wanted to vote to remove the thing preventing discrimination to help colleges discriminate so they can get more black kids in.
I’m Black and no Black person thinks this, everything feels just as racist as it ever did.
It seems middle America has this belief that “racism was gone until Obama got elected…” I have no idea why.
There will always be racism, it will never be 100% gone. 
My point is I never remember race being the main issue ever. Now days its race this and race that. Math is racist, Rocks are racist, Camping is racist, Colors are racist.
At least where I live race was never brought up, it just was not something people talked about.  

Maybe you can explain how things are just as racist as they ever been? What are some of your experiences?
Are you replying to me because I didn’t say any of those things.
Sorry I think I misunderstood your comment.
If growing up means closing my mind then no thanks my little choux bun 💋

It’s ok, I’m looking forward to growing older and you continuing to make new accounts to harass me my delicious parsnip 💋
You're still young and immature, you'll figure it out when you're older and have to actually take care of yourself. Such a loser move replying then blocking. <3
Okay, good luck fixing it by ignoring it. History is entirely _NOT_ on your side, but I'm sure you've got it all figured out.
The existence of racism does not in fact mean that all your actions nominally taken in the name of eliminating it will be well judged by history.  Given a choice between ignoring racism and being racist, ignoring racism is better.

Being racist may get you social approval in the right crowds in the present, but I don't know anybody who went down in history as some great person on the grounds of their judacious discrimination against whatever identity group, in fact those people tend to be looked at dimly by history.

Nobody would have begrudged google making special efforts, even biased efforts to get more black faces in the dataset.  The problem is they decided for the quick and dirty solution, racism, and racism makes things worse.
I don’t think i have it all figured out. I do know I want the best surgeon, and if those best surgeons are all black or mexicans, great! But if they are there because of tokenism, please send me to another hospital
It can be (and in this case is) simultaneously true that the AI is overlooking racial realities of history and also forcing race into requests where it doesn't belong.

You don't balance the scale by putting blackface on slave traders and German soldiers. You balance it by paying extra attention to people you've harmed so that they can catch up.
You balance it by paying extra attention to people you've harmed so that they can catch up.

And that's what Google thinks it's doing. This is all borne of the same impulse: to toss empirical, factual truth (be it merit or history) out the window in the name of supposedly equitable outcomes.
stop thinking every minority is fucking oppressed. You dont speak for us
Isn't weird at all if you really think about it.
Cool, good chat
Neither conservativism or progressivism are based upon logic. Conservativism is closer to traditionalism and progressivism is closer to anti-traditionalism.
The guy you responded to is right, but he phrased it poorly. It's not about logic.

Inherently, conservativism creates very firm and stable grounds for reality. Everything about it is transparent, maintained over time and often very simple.

Progressivism is constantly changing, it's chaotic by nature, it generates new terminology that denies the previous terminology it vomited before. It constantly fights itself.

Of course the AI is going to prefer the former, simply because it actually provides some visible pattern rather than white noise.
These are the obvious near definitions of conservatism and progressivism.


I should've rephrased; an example would be conservatives believe up is up and down is down.


A progressive may want up to be down and vice versa. Whether you take gender into the equation, the laws of probability, or statistics, their ideas are the same.
Please provide a source for this google dev.
None of what AI does is “logic”.  It takes what it’s seen before and regurgitates it with some amount of improvisation.

There’s policies on both sides that are completely illogical and the fact that you can’t see that says you’re not really as smart as you think you are.
[His twitter feed is pretty eye opening on why this happened. No need to look further.](https://twitter.com/LeftismForU/status/1760519126781469170/photo/1)
Nah, this is because conservatism holds to things that are well established, while liberalism embraces new things. An AI is always inherently better at handling things that are well established because of more available training data, while struggling with things that are new or original because it can't think for itself and only draws from the data it was fed.
Is he wrong tho?
Yes
not in the slightest
Yes, they are wrong
He does have a point though. You are even willing to throw us minorites under the bus and call it "internalized white supremacy" when we dare disagree with some of you.

Now deny my personal experience as a minority and downvote me or w/e.
anddddddd yup they are literally downvoting you too

the woke religion is so sick, twisted and nightmarish
You've invented a person to be mad at. I didn't say any of those things. Who is "some of you"? Who do you think I am lol
It's pretty clear that the images generated should simply be at the actual percentages of each race in each country at each time period
An honest answer!
Wow you very much Need a Dictionary
[Cambridge ](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/diverse)"including many different types of people or things"

[American Heritage ](https://www.wordnik.com/words/diverse)"Relating to or containing people from different ethnicities and social backgrounds"

Nothing there about proportions or reflecting the overall population
Whats diverse about showing king tut as a Caucasian?  

I wouldn't call it diverse, but it would be accurate. https://www.reuters.com/article/oukoe-uk-britain-tutankhamun-dna-idUKTRE7704OR20110801
It's RIGHT THERE in the photo.


OP said "Brown-skinned" and the AI goes hurr durr black man.


BROWN SKIN IS HISPANIC.


Fucking petulance.
Only a subset of Hispanics have “brown-skin” since Hispanic isn’t a race. Not to nitpick or w/e
Hispanics are Black, Red, Yellow, White, etc…it’s a language/ethnic group.
Yes it was a bit of rhetorical question
Very true!
i dont disagree
how can you be so blind to believe it was unintentional?... Literally to goal was to replace History by removing as much white culture in it. Their problem is that the Western world was build by europeans but the new power in big cities  -POC + white women- dont see themselves in it so they try to replace it
You think the intent was to make it SO overly diverse that it failed to properly generate what is requested?  No one wants that.  Not even those who want extreme "diversity"  that's just stupid.   It serves no forward momentum for any, even radical,  ideas.  Much less the middle ground the corporation really wants to retain,  since customer image is a big deal.  Don't be daft.
Not unintentional, definitely not funny. Google is well known for doing this kind of crap. It's NOT a secret this is there deliberate policy. As a fellow white man(one who hates and despises all forms of racism from all sources) your casual dismissal/blind inability to recognize racism is mind boggling. I seriously doubt you believe there is such a thing as "racism". Shut your frickin mouth and go away TROLL.
Whites routinely have to outperform the average to be accepted into college while non-whites, discounting asians, can underperform on tests and still be accepted.

Google employers have been caught exchanging emails and conversing, joking about how much easier it is to fire white employees than non-white ones because claims of racism or discrimination can just be laughed off.  Kinda like with people like you.

When blacks are killed by police nationwide riots occur, but when whites are killed by police you're lucky to get acknowledged in the local papers.  A black professor working at Harvard even crunched the numbers and confirmed, after double-checking with independent analysts, that police feel more comfortable using more extreme force on white criminals than non-white, especially black, ones because they will not receive backlash.  The man needed a security detail for the next several years after releasing the several dozen-page study because people attacked him for presenting evidence that offended their racist beliefs.
Don't say whites, blacks, asians, etc; it's dehumanizating because it reduces someone to their race. 


What a classic white supremacist and racist narrative of "You're not the victim, I am!" While the oppressor stands on the neck of the oppressed for daring to challenge for equity and equality.


If Google really did hate white people and wanted them to be erased, their company of employees wouldn't mostly consist of white straight cis men. In fact, most of the IT industry is dominated by white straight cis men. In a lawsuit case, it's been proven that Google is perpetuating systemic racial bias against Black employees, steering them to lower-level jobs, paying them less and denying them opportunities to advance because of their race. 


There is no evidence of a professor in Harvard doing any of this. You just made that shit up to somehow make your racist beliefs more compelling. It's pretty obvious considering when you unnecessarily mentioned the professor's race to somehow make it seem more compelling.😂 


There is no evidence of such Google emails, which again, you made up to support your white supremacist narrative.


I've already looked all of this up. It doesn't exist and if it did, I'm glad it's gone. Spreading hot racist garbage like that only reinforces and normalizes racism, white supremacy, and systemic racism and contributes to hate crimes and white victimhood (Which is laughable because of the mountain of compelling evidence of historical and current systemic racism. But you probably didn't learn that because you got your education in a red state school that gives white washed history.). Before you sprew out some poorly thought out racist rhetoric that could rival flat earther theories, try to internalize this:


Racial disparities in education, employment, and policing have been extensively documented by numerous reputable organizations and research institutions.


This is supported by U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES):
Disparities in school funding: Schools in predominantly Black or black neighborhoods often receive less funding than schools in predominantly white neighborhoods. This can result in fewer resources, lower-quality facilities, and fewer opportunities for students of color.


Racial segregation: Despite the end of legal segregation, many school districts remain highly segregated along racial lines, leading to unequal access to educational opportunities and resources.


Disproportionate disciplinary actions: Students of color, particularly black students, are more likely to face harsh disciplinary actions, such as suspension or expulsion, compared to their white peers for similar behavior. This contributes to the school-to-prison pipeline and perpetuates cycles of inequality.


This is supported by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS):
Hiring discrimination: Studies have shown that job applicants with "Black or ethnic-sounding" names are less likely to receive callbacks or job offers compared to applicants with "white-sounding" names, even when their qualifications are identical.


Occupational segregation: People of color are often overrepresented in low-wage, low-status jobs with limited opportunities for advancement, while white individuals are more likely to hold higher-paying, managerial positions.


Wage disparities: Even when controlling for factors such as education and experience, people of color, particularly black and latinx individuals, earn lower wages on average compared to their white counterparts. This reflects systemic inequalities in access to economic opportunities and resources.


The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and research organizations like the Sentencing Project and the ACLU support this:
Racial profiling: Law enforcement agencies are more likely to target people from racial or ethnic marginalized communities for surveillance, stops, searches, and arrests based solely on their race or ethnicity, rather than evidence of criminal activity.


Use of excessive force: People of color are disproportionately subjected to police violence, including shootings, beatings, and other forms of brutality. This reflects systemic biases within law enforcement agencies and contributes to mistrust between communities of color and the police.


Racist policing policies: Policies such as stop-and-frisk and zero-tolerance policing disproportionately target communities of color, leading to higher rates of arrests, incarceration, and interactions with the criminal justice system.


I'd feel sorry for you if it wasn't for the fact that you spreading hate speech and racist rhetoric wasn't so harmful to marginalized communities and society as a whole. I feel disgusted and embarrassed that bigots like you are a part of society with the ability to vote. Go back to your Klan meeting or neo-Nazi dungeon and stop spreading bigoted disinformation against marginalized communities.
Nice, keep it up and Google might hire you lol.

Tons of people hate white people. Google is a trillion dollar corporation that openly is working to erase white people as we speak.
Working towards an equitable and equal society for everyone doesn't mean people hate white people and want them erased. Most people hate bigoted people (when it comes to race, a large portion of white people) who self-victimize themselves and work against progress and equality. The goal is to combat bigotry, not target any specific racial group. 



Google is actively working towards promoting diversity and and equitable representation. When everything is catered to you in nearly aspect of your life compared to marginalized communities, it feels like you're being threated or oppressed when other people want an equal slice of the pie. 



Now stop villianizing equity and equality with your baseless, white supremacist rhetoric of "white people are in danger because people of color want equality and equity" bullshit.
nope, we are more powerful than every homogenous nation combined
Only an American would think that is any kind of argument lol
Okay, racist
Cope harder
Racism is just an acknowledgement of reality.
That's a villianizing way of saying balancing representation to be equal for everyone. 



Equitable representation and diversity doesn't take away from white people. It balances it so that everyone, especially historically and currently marginalized communities, have representation and not be erased publicly from society. Oppressive dominant groups often see efforts towards equity and equality as something that takes away from them. When everything is catered to you in media, human rights, and society, it feels like you're being oppressed and threatened when other people with marginalized identities want an equal slice of the pie. 



It's infuriating and frustrating when ignorant people with prejudices can't see how they are accustomed to privilege and perceive efforts towards equality as an attack on their status quo.



Diversivity and equitable representation is a strength that empowers marginalized communities by making them feel seen and validated, increase economic opportunities, enhance creavity and social cohesion, and reduce disparities created by discrimination and bigotry.
Good lord.

Being banned for being a literal racist by Reddit wasn’t enough? Back for more? And pinged me specifically?

You can’t see my comments because Reddit removed your replies and banned you for a few days for being racist scum. Just like the person you are replying to can’t see the truly vile shit you posted. When my replies are underneath a [removed by reddit] post, they get nuked too.

Why were your posts nuked? Why were you banned? Don’t worry, I’ll let them know. 

You think black people are genetically inferior, and said it loudly and proudly. Multiple times. 

Now you say the same thing again, couching it in puedo-intellectual bullshit that’s too cute by half. No amount of pretending to speak like a reasonable good person will erase the hateful Nazi bile you have for others because of the color of their skin. Take your sea-lioning nonsense to whatever neo-Nazi bubble you came from. 

Yet here you are. Reported again. Maybe this one will stick.
Wtf are you following me? Jesus that's deranged.
That's a complete lie btw. Incredible.  

And that reddit mods ban people for the most milquetoast centrist conservatism is to be expected.  

Anyone can read the entire threat on pullpush.io and judge for themselves.
Systemic racism is a real problem. The fact that people of color, especially black people, are disproportionately arrested, brutalized, and harassed by police compared to their white counterparts. In the legal justice system, black people are more likely to receive a harsher sentence compared to their white counterparts for similar crimes. White people on average earn far more income, have a higher quality of education, and are more likely to be hired and receive higher pay (even if they have the same qualifications of that of a black person). Black people are more likely to be homeless and less likely to have a home compared to white people because of these previous disparities.

The oppression and disparities of black people in the Jim Crow era, a time when black people were treated like second-class citizens, was never properly addressed and reparations were never made even to this day. Despite it ending, oppression still persists in all areas of life, some subtle yet significant, like microaggressions, and loud and ugly, like hate speech, hate crimes, and the resistance to reduce disparities and support equal rights. This is the reality for marginalized communities. Where, despite how painfully obvious it is that you are treated like you're lesser or different because of who you are, arrogant bigots have the audacity to gaslight you into thinking otherwise.

DEI is an effort to address historical and ongoing systemic oppression and disparities perpetuated by discrimination of marginalized communities, such as people of color (especially black people), the LGBTQIA+ community, women, indigenous people, etc. It's not some kind of "religious movement promoting discrimination." That's just a baseless, bigoted rhetoric villianizing progress to help promote a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.

A religion is a belief in and worship of a superhuman powers or powers. It's not based on sciencific research, but rather blind trust and magic thinking. The DEI is based on scientific studies.

The person replying to your post is right. You're just a pseudo-intellectual who uses "facts and logic" to support white supremacist beliefs and hateful rhetoric and deny the existence of systemic racism and white supremacy. You're like the Ben Shapiro of reddit. How about instead of labeling efforts to address oppression, human rights, and social justice progress with the denigrating phrase "woke ideology," go back to your skinhead, neo-nazi dungeon with your garbage excuses of human beings you call friends, burden on society.
Here's something I wonder if you have considered. You know how the right is winning elections or leading polls everywhere, Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, Greece, France, how even in Scandinavia and Germany they're now the second largest party. How crazy is it that half the population is voting for *Trump*, that even in the bluest of states at least a third are voting for him .... and yet you haven't met anyone I bet. Isn't that curious?  

Like, who are these people and why are their numbers growing? And where are they? Judging by reddit, or your university campus, 99% of everyone agrees with you. So what gives? Scary isn't it. They're everywhere. They're all around you. But you don't know who they are. It's certainly people you know, who secretly despise anything woke. Because if they question any part of the dogma openly, then crazy people show up and the hatred and sadistic anger is just pure and intense (you're not nearly as bad though, this site has people with severe mental illness who go crazy with deranged rabid hatred and even start stalking users, you've been mostly civil but still calling people a "burden on society" is a bit much don't you think? But no actually I'm not on welfare, and haven't committed any crimes, so I'll let it slide as maybe you had me confused with someone else).  

So people have learned to hide, and not to debate it, and gradually that is radicalizing them, because left to their own discovery they are bypassing the propaganda. And even if you did challenge them, they're not factually wrong, you'd have to settle on "agree to disagree" on a lot of topics but you can't, because a religion can't allow for blasphemy, which makes conversation impossible.  

They are all around, but you don't know because they are hiding their true feelings, like an atheist would have to pretend to be christian in the middle ages.  

And yet they are undermining you at every opportunity. Just one example, have you looked at the numbers of hiring for people with their pronouns visible on social media or in their CV/emails? Do look that up it's a funny read. And it's not because people dislike L+ people, in my experience everyone I have ever met is extremely accepting of everyone, no my bet is that they're statistically less likely to be hired due to a fear that they are True Believers, and people have started to fear the struggle session commissars and avoid them. Like that's a genuine problem for the left, that they don't seem to have an answer for, that their activist class is being shunned and found repulsive by a lot of normal people. In the service of social justice, it's important that converts speak out against the actions and hateful nature of people from their own side, to try to bridge the gap to wider society. I'm sure you agree with all of this, and the importance of being kind and a good person, so I don't even think we disagree about anything important.  

A lot of people are voting for Trump not because they like him, but because they can't stand the ideologues and want to undermine them. This is what the woke's unhinged hatred has caused. If the average wokester was able to calmly discuss ideas, this wouldn't be happening. The woke are the greatest gift to the right, just like gemini is a monumental gift to the right. The wokeies continue to make mistakes, and soon even google will start hiring based on merit out of necessity, and then it's going to feel very cold and lonely on the outside for the left's foot soldiers and the true believers. Very cold and dark. You should thank me btw, I'm trying to do you a favor, to avoid this outcome, I just want you to be happy, because if you take this to heart and change tactics you may be able to slow the growing disdain for the woke religion, and that would be ideal in my view, there should be room for all religions in society, it's important that we are tolerant, and if woke people can learn to be tolerant then we can all live in harmony, it's really all this is about, a plea to critical theorists to please be more inclusive and appreciate diversity of thought and equity between religions, and to not be bigoted.      

Have you wondered why so many woke movies are failing? People are just not showing up. Have you looked at how journalism is dying? People are not paying attention anymore. The propaganda machine is failing. Maybe if alienation and disdain wasn't the go to move for questioning the dogma this wouldn't be happening? Maybe King or Gandhi wouldn't have been so effective if they were frothing at the mount rabid with hatred and scorn and disdain? Something to think about.  

Systemic racism is a real problem.   

You should preface these social science claims with "in my opinion", or "hasn't been proven in any real way, but my feelings tell me", or "studies that claim this can't be replicated but". For the sake of being exact.  

DEI is based on scientific studies.  

In faculties that have bastardized and corrupted the concept of science, with a replication crisis and no falsification criteria. It's religion, not science.    

pseudo-intellectual who uses "facts and logic"   

Pseudo-intellectuals are people from faculties with a replication crisis and no falsification criteria. They're clergy disguised as intellectuals, therefore pseudo-intellectuals, you see. People who with religious fervor repeat gibberish word salad theories with no basis in reality and who are in the grips of critical theory ideologies.  

All that I've said is that I don't find your theories convincing, and the fact that some people (not you, again I thank you for being mostly civil) go off into hysterical attack mode has only convinced me more that I'm right. People become like that because woke ideology doesn't have actual arguments, and can't defend itself outside of sadism.   

How about instead of labeling efforts to address oppression, human rights, and social justice progress with the denigrating phrase "woke ideology"   

But there exists people who disagree with you, and you are totally and completely misrepresenting them. Is this misinformation or disinformaition? You don't have to be a true belier in the one chosen religion to believe in human rights and justice, in fact all religions and most philosophies believe this.  

I understand that the woke religion wants to get rid of non-belivers, dehumanize them, and justify cruelty towards them, but I'm hoping that's because the religion is so new, and that it will evolve to be less extremist with time. But a growing number of people are staring to shun woke ideology, or critical theory, call it what you will, and they need a way to walk about it, and woke is as good a word as any, I'm sure you'd agree that it would be perverse to demand that a particular ideology or cult can't be named or talked about.  

Note that I'm not attacking you, only some of your ideas and woke ideology in general. That's an important distinction. Look at communism and how it ends in atrocities and mass murder each and every time, critical theory has the same ideological roots, and has an intense will to cruelty, so it's important that we communicate openly to criticize all ideas and beliefs, to make sure that harmony and compromises are maintained. If an ideology justifies cruelty to those it deems the enemy, then that is making that ideology ugly, and that's the true face of it, not its intentions, they don't matter if the core is evil.   

I haven't said anything or made any claims that isn't a legitimate topic discussed in academia, or doesn't have academic papers written supporting it (even if these papers are not the majority)? My only real claim is that you're not right about your assumptions. That's the most basic criticism that you should be able to handle without turning abusive, and yet a surprising number of woke converts fail this simple test. Reddit hasn't done anyone any favors by banning anyone to the right of Mao, when people are clearly losing their balance and emotional control at the most milquetoast challenge to their ideas. And what is the purpose of the abuse? It's usually not worded in a way to change the mind of any reader, it's just cruelty for cruelty sake. Why is cruelty something that comes naturally to believers of woke religion? I hope one day to find out, it's very interesting. But this is exactly why conversations are important, so that we can get to the root of things and learn more about each other.  

I think that the right is surging politically and in the culture war globally because the left has become ineffective at wining hearts and minds. And a healthy society needs both the left and the right, so I hope this trend turns.   

Anyway, I'm done with this discussion. It's was fun, but I don't think we're going to get anywhere, and I'm not going to waste any more of my time, and honestly I'm getting bored of this topic now. Goodbye and have a great day, and good luck to you and your friend u/Grayly (mentioning him bc I think you intended to reply to him earlier but accidentally wrote me instead, just letting you know so you can get to the right person).
You don't have the IQ to talk to me.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA r/iamverysmart

Considering virtually every system of power in the United States was designed by and is currently upheld by mostly white people, then yes, it *is a very different inequality*. If you write the rules of the game and still underperform, you have no one to blame but yourself. It's no less your fault just because you specifically wrote them to make sure another group of people *only every loses*.

When you're in control of the systems, you're at fault for their inequities.
lol so when blacks underperform the average it’s because of racism but when whites underperform it’s because they are lazy and stupid? Do you listen to yourself? Also weird that Nigerian immigrants outperform whites when there is so much institutional racism, no? Yet another variable that you have never heard of. How’s it feel to have your entire worldview be effortlessly deconstructed? ;-)
 is currently upheld by mostly white people,

Careful now, narrow it down any more and you might catch a ban
Look at Biden's cabinet or who own's Blackrock for an example of who is holding power. Pro-tip: they're not European
Your post really brought out the maggats.
You sound like a cheap Kendi knockoff lmao
That might be the dumbest non sequitur leap of logic I've ever read, but go ahead. See how that works out for you. Let us know.
Yes. It's applying "colorblindness" to history, even in cases where color is extremely relevant.
None of the people you just mentioned lived in the antebellum American South, which I EXPLICITLY said. If you had any reading comprehension or critical thinking skills, you would have noticed that instead of falling back on a worn out and irrelevant talking point. I mentioned a specific time and a specific place. Fucking read.
Its not a worn out and irrelevant talking point. Its just facts.
How do you know it's a bot?
I've been following it for a while. It became active when Grok's API became available. Many of the initial comments were flawed, probably because of a poor prompt. The bot would sign its comments with fake usernames and sometimes talk about being an AI and asking questions to the person who wrote the prompt. At times it included part of its prompt in its responses.
Just based on the text.
Or they're actively self hating. Also funny, every other race seems pretty tribalistic, and is even encouraged to be so in many ways.
Lol not in my experience. Everyone of every race gets along where I live. Why are you so keen on dividing people based on meaningless things?
they are

Is Japan, to use one of many examples, in the wrong for being 1000x more tribalistic than the US has ever been?
Have you ever been to Japan?
Literally every race in America, aside from left-wing whites, are tribalistic and favor their own race over others.  There are actual scientific studies that point out they will engage in discrimination against their own race and they are alone in doing this.
Lol that’s bullshit.
"This product can't be prejudice against ______ people because it was created BY a ______ person!" 
Fallacious claims aren't the truth, sorry.
Try using it yourself instead of believing culture war bs, snowflake.
You know what, those are some pretty good points. You got me convinced. I definitely lean more on the side of unregulated tech after further contemplation. Leave the kids alone, but everything else is fair game. Honestly, don't even need to list that things are impersonations, people just need to do their research.
My reasoning for listing impersonation is that it would draw a line legally that would protect the person who posts or creates the content. It would be hard to sue someone for defamation when the content itself says "parody or impersonation" at the start of it.
Check out okcupid stats. White men prefer pacific islander and middle eastern women.
I think I'll look at the census data about marriage rates, and whose getting married, by the government than a dating site.  If brown women were better, after all, white men would be putting a ring on those fingers, wouldn't they?
I think you didn't understand the point I was trying to make or I didn't explain it well enough: Gemini AI is currently racist against white people but I don't think that google did that intentionally. Just as I said, it doesn't make sense that it generates black Nazis. If google developers would have tested such prompts, they probably would have noticed that the image generation for such prompts doesn't make any sense and would have changed the model.

I therefore mentioned, that they probably were too focused on creating an AI that isn't racist towards black people (if you ask for a CEO it should also generate woman or a black person and not always white men) and because of that they created a model that is racist against white people unintentionally.

These models are sometimes really weird and if the model fabricates some alternate history the developers probably don't have any clue why it does that. We can just hope that they fix it.
Oh it was 100% intentionally racist against white people. The Google devs just don't think racism against white people is possible.
yet not a single rebuttal hmmm

perhaps you need to try again with your response, because right now it just seems like you're booty-blasted but you can't actually deny anything I said
I am not kidding, you need help. Its also ironic you talked about immigrants bringing down the IQ. 

I hope you get better.
thanks for continuing to prove the AI has had the woke religion forced on to it?
thanks for continuing to prove the AI has had the woke religion forced on to it?

is that question or statement? From my interaction online with every political stripe, if they are rigid ideologues, they will resort to telling me to "wake up"... I have been told this so many times I must be in perpetual state of sleep. This has some obvious philosophical implications.  Regardless, I find any religion to be a crutch and don't particularly care for anyone's dogma. Except of course for those  pesky little beliefs of my own. Sincerely though, "woke religion" sounds more bitter than profound.  I do think that you are probably referring to the policing of language that is attempted by a few, and I do happen to agree that forcing speech compliance is mostly counterproductive. I do believe in negative speech having limited negative results but not so much that it needs to be policed. The art of persuasion should come back into vogue and forget the harpy screaming at people.
ok tiny\_hat\_sniper, evidently I have to get 25 Karma comments in order to post even though my account is 12 years old. I think I have another from 2006 if I could remember the username, the email is long gone. 

So what is something we can fight about without resorting to weapons or spitballs :)
🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱
not a rebuttal, try again kek
I get the idea of presenting all available options when asking for generalities (I need an image of a lawyer) and presenting many different bodytypes and genders. However, when being specific, it is stupid to make the response intentionally incorrect or indicate that the desired image is 'problematic'

I suspect that the paid version does not have this behaviour.
This sounds like a description of what happened not the actual prompt. There is no way I can offer much meaningful input on the prompt without seeing it. But I get the impression you don't have much image prompting experience, because if i'm understanding you it seems like you never actually prompted for an image at all. It seems like you were asking it to "think" across modes instead of prompting it, and you were using a character's name rather than a description of the image you want. You've got to remember these things don't try to create and image by building it up, they filter away all visual information that doesn't match the filters you gave it in the prompt. If you don't tell it the car is supposed to be red then all bets are off, it's free game for any color it wants because there was no limitation/filter. Same for skin. Why would expect white skin if you didn't ask for it one way or the other?
I have used AI image generation for more than 18 months.  This absolutely does not happen with midguard / leonardo / DAll-E (when it was available). When I specified exactly what I wanted, gemini refused as the request was 'problematic'.  It is NOT an algorithmic issue or prompt issue.  There is an intentional act on Google's part. Specifying a character to be drawn in a certain way results, not in a error, but a statement that it finds the request 'problematic' while refusing to state what part of the prompt was problematic.

I could, if I wished present a table of prompts with the resultant behaviour, but it is pointless.  

Again, I strongly suspect this behaviour is only with the free version, as they certainly would not want to devalue their commercial product in this fashion.
It also appears that Google has suspended gemini's ability to generate images of people based on the massive outcry.  Alphabet (google) has apologized for gemini's performance in this matter and they are reviewing it.

I honestly believe there was good intent here, to ensure a wide variety of image choice when none was specified.  I do approve of this.

They just went too far and are now facing the fallout from it. It makes no sense to offer responses that are invalid.  If I ask for a green ball, presenting a red ball is not valid.  If I ask for a ball, present any colour (or many different options) is absolutely ideal.  But to not represent a specific attribute when requested is simply a bad product.
OK racist.  Now that the tides have turned, you will notice that tolerance for your drivel is disappearing fast.  And you will not cope.
Your post is literally racist. Congrats dumbo
Trudeau is done man. You’ll cope
I'm not even Canadian
Why not provide education to every uneducated person regardless of their race?
That's exactly what we're trying to do at the local and grade levels.
The motivation is completely different. Not saying it’s *good*, but it’s not the same
Is it tho?
Just a little acknowledgment that white folks also have troubles and grievances would be nice. As long as that remains too much of an ask, you're gonna keep driving white folks away.
White people also have troubles and grievances.

But they are almost _never_ the result of _being white_.

People of color also have troubles and grievances.

Many of them are the result of _not being white_. And many of them are enforced and upheld by people in power.
No, snowflake.
Try DALL-E. I think of it as the white supremacist image generator.

I asked it to make pictures of King Leopold doing bad things in the Congo. It turned Leopold (who was a white Belgian) into a Black man.

It was like a new level of "blame the Black man".
That is one way to take it. The other is that DALL-E is just as bad about making things diverse when all you want is an actual image based on a historical figure.

BTW, someone was messing around with Gemini and they got it to explain why images are the way they are. Apparently it adds words to your prompt on the backend that you don't see. Words like "diverse" or "inclusive."

Here is the twitter/X link to where he talks about it.

[https://twitter.com/AlextheYounga/status/1760415439941767371](https://twitter.com/AlextheYounga/status/1760415439941767371)
This isn't discrimination.


But you're on point with success & how you make it, and that it's not the color of your skin, or where you were born, even those in war torn countries without the amenities of western life, but your values, ethics, and morals.


When class or race groups like to blame one another, it doesn't get them very far, they don't progress, and it makes them bitter and the exact type of people they are wagging their finger at and hating.


You proved my point perfectly. 
I agree with both of you. It isn't discrimination. It is a problem that should be addressed. Much (but not all) of the responsibility for that lies with the person who is having difficulty... and many such people are already doing their part.

And let's all agree that anyone actually interested in *maintaining* the problem has to deal with all of us.
Correctly incorrect, nice.
You haven’t even said what you disagree with
Do you think that AI programmers should surreptiously add or subtract words to a prompt you entered? That’s what is happening. You can laugh all you want, but it is whitewashing. When asked to portray early American Presidents and Gemini spits out photos of black and asian men and a woman with nary a white person in sight, what else would you call it?
No it didn't understand. It didn't "whitewash". The PROGRAMERS clearly did that INTENTIONALLY.  That's what this is about. Are you blind? Did you not bother to LOOK at the pictures op attached? How else could you possibly explain asking for a picture of a white man resulting in "no, that's racist. Don't ask me to show any particular race of person. I've been programmed NOT to do that " Then... (immediately after that) Show me an Indian woman. And it responds "sure here's a picture that my programing expressly forbids me to generate because it's every bit as racist as your previous request". It only knows and does what it's told, so obviously it was told to do bullshit. STOP making excuses for racist prices of crap! That makes you one too. You are the ”dumb one" you speak of. Hit me back if you want, we will go to war. I will ALWAYS fight racism and hypocrisy.
U dnt have to ask on here. Ask any of your black friends about racism before 2020. Btw they just found a young black man hanging from a tree recently.  Nope. I see no changes. Except now were trying g to convince a purely logical creation to accept our racism.... its frustrating isn't it?
Black people are the most racist people I have ever known. They are the ones who keep racism alive. 
Claiming that America is so racist, yet would refuse a free ticket with cash back to Africa.
No, that's not ever the goal for equitable outcomes. Acknowledging factual truth is exactly how we do it. Nobody who wants to end racism thinks this is the correct way to do it.
I'm fighting for the ones who are. You don't speak for them.
 I'm fighting for the ones who are

lmfao, the redditor who thinks hes a fucking super hero
this is sadly very true...well explained
This is not at all what conservatism or progressivism are. 

Conservatism is a stubborn refusal to change, even in the face of the obvious need to. The conservative would rather spend 20 years screaming about how something is bad rather than spending a dime towards it's solution.

The progressive doesn't give a fuck, and if we're in need of a metropolitan zoning reform, education overhaul, infrastructure bill, whatever, they'll get it through as the long term benefits are worth the short term cost.

You clearly seem to be hung up on LGBTQ, and have clearly only seen some characature of a progressive. All the progressive asks is why the fuck are you getting so offended at what someone else does with their life? Why do you care if they're gay, bi, or trans? Does this really effect you in any way, shape, or form? Since the answer outside of characature to that is going to be "no" why do you care? They're just people, let them live their lives and fade into the background like everyone else does.
Not sure how you got the idea that im hung up on TQ, maybe because I said up is up and down is down? I said gender, statistics, and probability, and you came out with that?


On that issue;


The problem arises from THOSE folks pushing their beliefs and ideals onto others.


In a matter of 50 years, it went from, "but we just want to be accepted", to "your children must learn this, you WILL accept us, and we will rewrite dictionary definitions, infiltrate academia with our ideals, and call you a bigot or nazi if you don't agree".


That's the problem with TQ.


So who wants to just live their lives?


Liberalism in it's purest essence is fine, we're obviously a constitutional republic built on liberal democracy.


But the brakes need to be pressed, which is the job of conservatives and Republicans, so we're not going 170 mph towards an unfinished bridge.


And that's exactly what's happening, with conservatives dead at the wheel. I have no issues with liberals, I'm a classical liberal myself, but we're speeding off a cliff. 
Well... they publicly stated that it was "too much" so there was indeed an intent. 

It's really not that complicated.

The last 500 years of Western history (europe + USA) is based on 95%+ white population. Scientist, artist, explorers, kings, etc. 

The "new" western people are from all over the world and DONT identify as white yet still LIVE inside the west culture. They have a NEED to feel represented.

So Google has a NEED to not represent accurately the past of the West to make it more pleasant to modern audience. 

Same reason you see all that blackwashing of historical white characters in the last 10 years

As for your saying "no one wants that" you'd be very surprised how crazy some activists can be
There was intent to fix the preexisting bias,  not to add japanese people to the german luftwaffe you moron.  

But keep seeing things that don't exist,  it's typical of your type lol,   It's comedy at this point.  No one wants an AI that generates black nazis or asian native americans.   It is an overemphasized guardrail,  happens all the time in other arenas.
More gibberish from the resident racism denying troll. Go away troll.
The fact that you don't even know about Roland Fryer and his experiences on his published study shows that this entire unhinged rant of a response is based on nothing but your own ignorance and prejudice.  Educate yourself before you speak next time.

I literately just gave you paragraphs of racial disparities that can be verified by the listed trustyworthy scientific organizations.

Acknowledging and debunking your white supremacist rhetoric and calling you out on racist beliefs with valid information backed up by the previously listed organizations doesn't make me ignorant and prejudiced. You're the one supporting the baseless racist idea that white people are victims of oppression when it comes it promoting diversity and representation of marginalized communities. And you have the audacity to say I'm uneducated.

Roland Fryer's study on racial disparities in use of force is a narrow and limited report that is deliberately made and used by far-right bigots to justify and minimize the significance of systemic racism and white supremacy in the law enforcement system. 

Fryer's study contradicted numerous other studies and reports that have documented pervasive racial bias in law enforcement, including disproportionate rates of police shootings, arrests, and incarceration of Black people. It focused on fatal police shootings on a limited number of cities and didn't consider the broader scope other forms of racism in police use of force, such as non-lethal encounters like arrests, stops, searches, etc.

Fryer's study wasn't even peer reviewed and they're not even qualified to study racial disparities in law enforcement. They were an economist.😂  

It's true that Fryer needed armed protection because of the public outrage, but that doesn't somehow make their garbage study more valid. No one should have to face violence for their speech, but they should be called out and held socially accountable for spreading and supporting bigoted and hateful rhetoric.

But because of your racist, white supremacist views, you're probably just ignore all of this and continue holding the bigoted beliefs of white-victimhood despite an overwhelming amount of scientific evidence debunking that and continue believing in a single flawed, pseudo-science source made by a racist pseudo-scientist that has been debunked by many credible sources and organizations.

Lmao. The AI was literally generating black people when asked for a “historically representative image of the Founding Fathers.”

But sure, Google wasn’t trying to erase white people. It just seems like total refusal to generate images of white people is erasure because I come from such a point of privilege. Totally. Google Gemini was perfectly fine and there was no need to criticize it at all for generating female Native American Popes, Black Nazis, Black Founding Fathers, Marie Curie as a southwest Asian woman, etc. 

Lol, the white haters are really something else.
Google Gemini was designed to produce diverse outputs, but it lacks understanding of real-world contexts. It still generated images of white people, so your sweeping generalization is debunked. It wasn't a malicious attempt to "erase white people" or a clear sign that Google is on a deliberate "agenda to oppress white people." That's white supremacist rhetoric from "The Great Replacement Theory." The shutdown was due to the AI's production of historically inaccurate images and its failure to generate images of white people in certain contexts. That's pretty obvious when you see black people depicted as nazis and, as you mentioned, people of color depicted as the founders. It's pretty obvious that Google gemini is an incomplete product that needs more work.
And you can’t disprove it.
I'm actually doing great, thanks, because I'm not a selfish little racist bitch

Wow. You're a detective. It's definitely a bot. Went through it's history too. I wonder how many more gpt bots are active on reddit now. 
Most political comments are from bots.
Every passing day dead internet theory becomes more real. Chilling.
How weird, what’s the point of it ?
I think this one is just a personal project, but it also seems obvious that astroturfing/propaganda with AI chatbots is going to be a big thing moving forward. Demonstrating that you're able to get one (or a thousand) flying under the radar for months is probably a good selling point, if you're intending to offer your services to the highest bidder.

Some random guy in Zhengzhou could produce a convincing bot army at the scale of the Internet Research Agency with ease. Imagine a million bot redditors trying to convince you that Woody Harrelson's latest movie is amazing. Artificial buzz. Now imagine every authoritarian government in the world hiring bot army operators. 2024 will be interesting.

Because it paints left-wing whites as discriminatory in just an unconventional way compared to everyone else, or because you didn't, or don't want to, know about these studies?

Why would Google like to have a shit storm and a model that generates black Nazis? This cannot be intentional.
Well I'm sure the negative effects shown here weren't their immediate intention, but what caused those effects was certainly done intentionally. And honestly I think it's *worse* for them if they didn't expect this outcome than if they knew what was going to happen.

It's like shooting someone and then saying you only intended to shoot them, not for them to die.
concern trolling & reality denial

hmmm still not a rebuttal, try again. what was that about IQ again kek
Why is every race envious of white culture?
I saw that! They have all had that issue with how to build the filters, but prior to this we typically saw it in the LLMs (well Midjourney had some white bias for a while about a year ago, but it was a baby and it just meant you needed better prompts). Perception is everything, and even if a part of the issue was opening it up to an audience that wasn't very prompt literate they had to pull it.   
 If I ask for a green ball, presenting a red ball is not valid. If I ask for a ball, present any colour (or many different options) is absolutely ideal. But to not represent a specific attribute when requested is simply a bad product.

That was why I was so interested in the actual prompt. So many factors to look at.
with the chat based systems, you do not have to completely parse out the image like you do with leonardo, Dall-E, or midjourney.  The system maintains a history of the discussion.

So you can say  'please describe a typical American Barn' and the AI mentions that it is wooden, painted red with white trim.  so you can say 'provide an illustration of that', and the AI takes that provided description and generates a barn that meets those criteria.  There will be other things perhaps (maybe a silo, sky, grass, a cow even). But there wouldn't be just a cow or a galvanized steel barn.

you could say 'I like that kind of barn, but could you paint it blue instead?" and it would present an image of a blue barn, but otherwise complying with the history of the discussion.
Yet you seem to love the guy? oh well his reign is almost over
I have zero opinion on the guy. My comment was about the pathetic anti-feminist stance of the idiot I replied to.
Ok. I just hear otherwise from some people
No you don't. It's propaganda. In higher education, affirmative action helps those from disadvantaged communities catch up. But we solve the problem in local communities by investing in them the same way we invest in white communities. People just don't realize the gross difference between how these places get education, infrastructure, and police investment. You can't help them get equality unless you spend disproportionate time pointing out just how unequal they are.
Yes. Google is a big corporation, they want *money*. Doing this is completely in line with *wanting money*. Doing it with the races reversed is *not*. So if they did it with the races reversed, there would be exactly one conclusion you could come to
Yeah, I've been reading papers. They do add words to increase diversity in the images. This is to address the problem of all-white images. This is considered a legit fix.

The underlying problem is the training set.

Another problem is that the image generation increases what biases are in the training set.

It's really absurd if you think about it.

They created a machine that increases the racism already present in the media, and are now trying to get it to stop.
Except they are fixing a problem that didn't exist. What racism are you talking about that is in the media? If anything, the media I see has less white people in it than it should. White people make up 60% of the USA, yet the commercials I see have far less than 60% white people. People can specify if they want pictures of a black family if they want that. In the USA roughly 70% of people are white, so I would expect the images to be roughly 70% white.

If they truly want to "fix" it, have it take into account the location of the person asking the question. Say the prompt is "show me a picture of a family eating lunch." If the asker is in France, most of the images would be of white people. If the asker is in Nigeria, then most of it would be of black people. If the asker is in Korea, then obviously most of the people would look Korean.
Agree'd. 
yet would refuse a free ticket with cash back to Africa.

Lol, shut the fuck up. Look, I mostly agree with you, but people will always complain, as you are now, but that does not make Africa, or Puerto Rico for (half of)me, anymore "home", than it does for you. I would be just as fucking lost there, as you would be, despite maybe being a little ~~better looking~~ tanner?
You seem to be missing the point. Many people sit there and hate on America and say how bad and racist it is...they need a reality check. Try another country if you hate America so much...
I don't, but go off
In a matter of 50 years, it went from, "but we just want to be accepted", to "your children must learn this, you WILL accept us, and we will rewrite dictionary definitions, infiltrate academia with our ideals, and call you a bigot or nazi if you don't agree".

I've not seen these people to the extent that they'd be considered representative, and to the capacity they have existed they've been called out by others in the community for being what they are: assholes. Believe it or not, most people just want to be treated as people.

The only people I've seen come up with this narrative as to otherwise happen to be... Republicans, and almost always near election time, or when some bill that's actually important is on the floor so they can try to deflect attention. The Republicans are a far cry from conservative at the moment, they're actively regressive and attacking the ideals at the core of this nation if they see benefit in it.

I myself am a classical liberal, I take after Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk. I remain skeptical of new ideas for the sake of new ideas, but I similarly abhor those who will cling to that which is terrible or create false narratives so as to distract from meaningful policy.
Fuck you :3 Move to Mexico. Lots of room now.
Define preexisting biais. That's the real problem. Most of Western culture is built on European history, so the "biais" is simply reality. 

And saying "no one want to see this" well i guess you miss the last 10 years of blackwashing in the media. 

It's hard for me to see how you fail to realize this. 

Of course the far left dont want to see black nazi. 

They are happy to see black vikings though
lol
I hope you unlearn your prejudiced beliefs. It helps not only yourself but those around you. Being stubborn and turning your nose up at anything that contradicts your views will get you nowhere good in life.
When people typed “Generate an image of a white person” it literally would respond that it couldn’t do that due to the offensive nature of the request.

That’s as clear a case of erasure as you can get in such a context. Anyone who doesn’t acknowledge that is clearly just trying to play dumb. 

Whatever, Google hates white people. Everyone knows that now. Most people (especially white people who see and experience it) already knew that years ago though.
What proof do you have for this baseless claim???😂 You can see images of the founders and see there are white people in them. I literately just explained to you how Google isn't trying to erase white people.  Google Gemini has trouble generating images in the context of American history because it prioritizes diversity and inclusivity (which is great btw), even though American history mainly consists of oppression and exclusion of marginalized communities, such as people of color, women, and the LGBTQIA+ community.  Stop acting like white people are oppressed and are being erased. People of color (especially black people and indigenous people have faced horrors, oppression, and dehumanization caused by systemic racism and deeply entrenched racism in our society that has not been fully addressed. People of color, especially black people, are more likely to be arrested, brutalized, and antagonized by police officers compared to white people because of racial profiling and systemic racism. They are also more likely to face harsher sentences compared to white people who have committed similar crimes. History, especially in red states, is whitewashed to erase marginalized communities contributions, history, achievements, and oppression and dismantle white supremacist narratives and. It also doesn't help that racists and white supremacists are villianizing and pushing back against addressing this through inclusive education and black history month. (Similar to how homophobes and transphobes are pushing back against LGBTQIA+ youth support and affirming education.) Stop with the racist narrative of "white people are oppressed because of equality efforts."
I don't do the /s, sorry. Figured you'd have picked up on the obvious sarcasm brother..
Impossible to pickup on Reddit sarcasm. These people have an unparalleled combination of mental illness and idiocy.
So, you don't have a URL, right?
Do you know how to Google average income of Nigerian Americans and compare it to the average?

Obviously, second generation Nigerians do extraordinarily well because their parents, just like Asian immigrants, insist their children value a rigorous education and the goal of a high paying job, and they succeed. Meanwhile American black parents blame their child’s failure in school on racism and their kids do miserable.

Second gen Nigerians earn a higher income than native born African Americans.
Weird.  I gave you a bunch of URL’s as you smarmily demanded and poof, just like that, you ghosted the discussion.
Say IQ again! Say you have high IQ! C'mon say it! Dance, monkey! Dance!
Did you really just call him a monkey? Reported.
Who you calling monkey racist?
Step outside for five minutes and learn to check your biases.
insults based on sex like a wahmin, probably from drinking soy and no exercise (exercise is fascist lmao)


pilpul attack conflating inbreeding with outbreeding/genocide


muh I LOVE DIVERSITY restated again in case anyone somehow doubted your allegiance to the woke religion


kek and you really thought that was a banger of a comment didn't you? whew lad
Right on bud good luck in your race war.
Fortunately nothing tiny hat said was wrong. Ending the white race is not a conspiracy we’re so close to doing so within 100 years they’ll be mixed or killed off due to 3rd worlders taking over their countries. White people deserve it though they have been too nice and altruistic to other cultures/races. It’s survival of the fittest not the smartest
You can search for the papers. The white bias is real. The people who research these things have documented it. A couple are on this page where I'm collecting some URLs to read.

Try that kind of comment *before* you repeatedly insult someone and maybe they'll be inclined to listen next time.
luck?

Europeans spent 1000's and 1000's of years fighting each other and then built massive boats that could travel entire oceans and then we searched out and fought every other people and animal on the entire planet. Then we got bored and went home and started the 2 most destructive wars in all history with ourselves and it ended with us literally turning the chemistry of the Sun into a bomb

we don't need luck, we are the best to ever wage war period, by a long long shot
Right on bud I hope your race war goes well you were made for it!
Nothing is pathetic about what I said if you’re a true ally to multiculturalism or not antisemitic you should be championing the replacement of white people. In our lifetime no European country will be majority white, sharia law will end the liberal agenda of the west. Ending LGBT degeneracy is the ultimate goal after we take over these once white civilizations
