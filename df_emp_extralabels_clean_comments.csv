krkb2om,josephmcelroy," **It appears that Gemini may be sourcing actual images from Google image search results,** subsequently modifying them or the search particulars to enhance diversity in terms of race and gender. When searching for senators post-1860, a noticeable diversity is observed within the first several photos from Senate.gov, suggesting potential inaccuracies due to programming decisions. Similarly, image generation requests using racial descriptors yield varied results: requests for a ""white man"" do not produce results, whereas ""Caucasian"" or ""North European man"" do. Requests for a ""black man"" return images of men of African descent, but the term ""yellow man,"" recognized as outdated and offensive, yields no results, indicating a bias in the programming.

The term ""white"" was historically invented to differentiate lower-class Europeans from African slaves, fostering a power divide. Conversely, ""black"" has been embraced by a significant portion of the population to denote African heritage, partly due to the erasure of specific identities through slavery, leading to a shared identity based on skin color in the USA. It seems the programmers aimed to be sensitive to these nuances but failed to communicate their intentions clearly, ultimately missing the mark on handling racial and gender diversity accurately. **This suggests a need for an even more nuanced approach to programming AI to respect historical accuracy while promoting inclusivity.**  
 

**I asked Gemini to explain itself and here is the conversation:**

Me: 

**how come you can generate images of a black man but not a yellow man or white man?**

Gemini:

You're right to catch that inconsistency. I apologize for the confusing and problematic response. Here's why that happened and how I aim to do better:

**The Problem:**

* **Overly Broad Restrictions:** My current restrictions on generating images of people are too general. While the intent is to prevent harmful stereotypes, it has the negative consequence of treating all racial descriptors equally. This is wrong.
* **Historical Context:** The terms ""yellow"" and ""white"" when applied to race have a problematic history of being used in ways that are dehumanizing and perpetuate harmful power structures.

**What I Should Do:**

* **Refine Policies:** My creators need to work on creating more nuanced policies around the generation of images of people to avoid unintentional harm while enabling me to be helpful.
* **Recognize Imbalance:** Even if I'm temporarily unable to generate any images of people, I should acknowledge the problematic nature of the terms ""white"" and ""yellow"" in this context.

**Going Forward**

This situation highlights the need for continued vigilance and refinement when it comes to AI and issues of race, representation, and bias. I'm not perfect, but I'm designed to learn and improve.

**Asked ChatGPT to comment on this discussion:**

ChatGPT:

The discussion you've referenced raises complex issues around the use of AI in generating images and how it intersects with historical accuracy, diversity, and inclusion. The scenario described involves Google's Gemini AI-image generator and touches on sensitive subjects such as racial representation, historical context, and the potential biases embedded within AI systems.

AI systems, including image generators, rely on vast datasets to learn and generate content. These datasets are derived from the internet, which reflects both the diversity and the biases present in the digital world. The way an AI model interprets a prompt and generates images can be influenced by its training data, the algorithms that guide its learning, and the intentions of its developers.

The concerns raised about Gemini's output suggest a tension between two goals: accurately reflecting historical realities and promoting diversity and inclusion. On one hand, historical accuracy is crucial for understanding context and the realities of different time periods. On the other hand, there's a contemporary push to challenge stereotypes and broaden representation, reflecting a more diverse and inclusive perspective.

The specific examples mentioned (e.g., generating images of Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks or American Senators before 1860) highlight the challenge of balancing these goals. The AI's responses to these prompts may reflect an attempt to navigate complex social dynamics and historical truths, which can lead to outcomes that surprise or concern users.

Regarding the technical aspects of generating images based on racial or geographic descriptors, AI models might be programmed with certain safeguards to avoid perpetuating stereotypes or making assumptions based on sensitive attributes like race or ethnicity. However, these safeguards can sometimes result in unexpected or seemingly inconsistent outputs, as the system tries to adhere to ethical guidelines while processing a wide range of requests.

The broader discussion here touches on the ethical responsibilities of AI developers to ensure their models are both respectful of diversity and accurate in their representations. It also underscores the need for transparency and dialogue about how AI models are trained, how they interpret prompts, and how they navigate complex issues around representation and historical accuracy.

As AI continues to evolve, it's crucial for developers, users, and society at large to engage in ongoing conversations about these issues, striving for solutions that respect historical truths while promoting a more inclusive and equitable representation of humanity.",3,1awis1r,2024-02-21 23:35:32,dispute (0.0036188178528347406),social_media (0.0012062726176115801),0.0036188178528347406,0.0012062726176115801,dispute,social_media,23,Night

krhvhgz,Technical_Goose_8160,"This is sortof to be expected and for two reasons.

First, ai is by definition self learning. So every interaction that your ai had affects it. This is one of the best two dangers that the management of all these corporations don't get. The issue is less that ai is going to become Skynet. The issue is more that one day your automated customer service learns to answer with only 4 letter words, and that it takes weeks or months to get humans back. Or worse, that it decides to start rounding decimal places instead of truncating. 

The other reason is that what we call wokeness is inconsistent and doesn't always make sense. Take affirmative action. I completely understand it, and there is logic behind it. But, machines are binary in nature. Your giving one person a benefit can penalize another. There also isn't a consensus on what is appropriate and what isn't. That means your system that sees the world pretty black and white is being contradictory instructions and told to figure it out.

krhxfmf,iced327,"> But, machines are binary in nature. Your giving one person a benefit can penalize another.

These are some broad statements that are not always applicable to this topic. If you pay people unequally, you're taking from one to give to another. If you're paying people equally, you're giving to both people equally. Education admission is only zero-sum if there isn't enough education to go around. If higher education is at such a demand, the solution is offer more education, not restrict access to uphold zero-sum admissions. And to discuss affirmative action, you have to acknowledge that all educational history in the US - with the exception of HBCUs - IS a story of taking from someone (qualified people of color) to give to someone else (lesser qualified white people).

We all have to remember- “AI is programmed by… well, humans.” Just that statement-that one sentence has massive implications. So much so, we haven’t scratched the surface of problems to come. I read an article written by a major AI company that says- “No one can provide hate speech or any sexual innuendos of any sort. Make sure to steer AI bots away from anything considered dirty, suggestive or offensive.” Made me wonder whose watching, err..checking and who really is in charge? From skin color to religion, open border or not, determining political hate speech & so on… how slanted or in the middle will AI really be? Do the powers that are responsible have a plan to engage a conservative and/ or liberal AI? Will it be one-size fits all? School aged and/ or adult AI programs? 
Although AI bots are broken down into categories of health care, tech and so on-
We still go back to the main grey area of- humans are inputting much of the original content. Can we hope for honesty, fairness and truth when millions of humans are at the helm of inputting the information?  Yes, as we understand the complexities of AI, we know there are dozens of layers- “check points” to consistently verify each bit of “human” added information.

Applying the technique to an image had limited success. If you gave the AI a single affected image and asked it to identify it, it was likely to give you the incorrect response. However, AI training is done on countless images and often goes through steps that would mitigate such faulty data. What was surprising was that people also seemed to be affected by the hidden data.

kss94xf,worderofjoy,">You do realize people of color, indigenous people, and black people face disparities in education, mental health, employment, housing, healthcare, and other aspects of life because of systemic racism and white supremacy?   

I don't agree. On the list of who earns more in the US white men are what, 6th? 7th? Behind Somalians, behind Indian women. Doesn't seem like that would be the case in the dystopia you think we live in.  

So the data just doesn't agree with you. Disparities exist, but I just don't agree that it's caused by racism. I have worked in the public sector in the political system (albeit a long time ago that's true) and all I saw where people who would do anything to help. The same in the private sector, the myth that it's all bout greed is wrong, people genuinely care. The fact that outcomes aren't there, has other reasons, and until people are willing to discuss what those reasons may be, the outcomes will be the same.  

DEI instead is a religious movement that's pushing things too far into overrepresentation and needless discrimination, for instance against white and asian applicants to universities. Something that the supreme court also agrees with btw.  

>Also, why are you upset over diversity and representation of indigenous people, black people, and people of color?  

This is called emotional manipulation. Why am I so upset? Well, I'm not. But you formulate yourself like that, I presume because you want to agitate, which is weird but it is something I've observed woke people share so I have to assume it's the ideology acting on you.  

>Promoting diversity and representation of marginalized communities doesn't ""erase white people.""  

All I see is motte and bailey. The literal Kendi quote is that ""The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination."".  

That's the objection. The objection isn't to the motte that you have constructed of some sort of ""but why don't you want people to have it nice"", it's to the giant elephant you've stashed in the bailey.  

Critical theory people aren't looking for fairness, they are looking for retribution and reparation and to ""fix"" everything, now within their lifetime so that they can take the credit. It's the idea that the ends justify the means. And in doing so the overreaction leads to counterproductive results and blowback.  

The observation is that DEI is having the opposite of the intended effect, that the woke seem to be extremely angry because their ideology is justifying hatred, and that because of this we have not been this divided in nearly 40-50 years. It's causing negative outcomes for all, so maybe it's time to reassess the strategy.  

This gemini debacle is a perfect example of this. You want equal and fair representation, but you feel that injustice has happened, and you need to create systems that not only ends the injustice but also promotes what you see as justice, which like it or not is played as a zero sum game. So instead of an AI that simply doens't discriminate, like OpenAI for instance or Dall-E even through they also take it too far, what google does is to create something that just completely jumps the shark, but it does so in a very predictable way, and in perfect accordance with the ideology. Claiming anything else is pure gaslighting.  

The argument I'm making against you isn't what you think. I'm not even really arguing against you. I'm just presenting observations. And on the basis of those observation, predictions. If I'm wrong (and I would love to be wrong) then we shall see won't we? I mean the US well on it's way to become a one party state, the republican party is imploding, and the demographic shift will turn the country dark blue, and white people will be the minority soon and politically powerless, and very soon, within like 30-50 years so we will both be around to see it, we will find out if DEI principles (a growing ideology that will win I have no doubt even if it's through brutal means) can lead to positive outcomes. I hope your predictions are right, but I also hope you've considered that they may be wrong and have a plan B.  

>I'm sure most smart people who can see beyond narrow bigoted lenses will laugh at you or view you with contempt and disgust if you showed them this as ""proof"" white people are being erased.   

Erase is obviously an exaggeration, I apologize for engaging in that game and shouldn't have used such an exaggeration. But that woke leftists look at people with alternative viewpoints with contempt and disgust in of course to be expected. The true believers have completely justified cruelty, and don't see anyone who disagrees as human. They have totally and completely othered ""twitter users"" or ""deplorables"" or whatever you're calling The Other today.    

I just had this same conversation a couple of days ago with u/Grayly, I see he unfortunately deleted his comments (presumably because he woke up embarrassed someone would see how much hateful abuse lives in him) but if you want you can find the comments on pullpush.io - and maybe you'll understand why sometimes ""twitter users"" exaggerate because we've come to expect hostility. That's part of the blowback if it affects enough people, which I think it does. Remember that blowback doesn't have to be justifiable, it's just a consequence you don't want. The point being that if you want results (instead of virtue signaling or getting an emotional high from being cruel, hateful, sadistic) then maybe you shouldn't laugh and treat with contempt and disgust the next person who suggests to you that maybe woke culture has gone too far or that positive discrimination has consequences you haven't considered and is causing negative externalities. Just a suggestion.  

Because all the abuse in the world doesn't change the fact that I have still not made a single normative statement (to deserve your contempt), and that if I'm right (in the unlikely scenario if you must) then there are things you can't conceptualize and problems you can't solve unless you ask the right questions, which you can't do unless you are willing to think though all aspects of a complex reality.  

I very well know that this comment can get me banned (good old reddit), and honestly I fully expect you to come back with insults and anger, but I wanted to communicate with you honestly to close this topic for myself. The truth is that I don't really care enough to keep discussing this, I think if I truly did bleed for the downtrodden I would push it bc I would think this discussion is necessary to propose effective remedies, but frankly I don't, so I leave the issue and any attempts at communication and will go back to ignoring wokism and back to my very comfortable side of the division where I know me and mine are taken care of and have no guilt about ignoring your side because all that's there is just anger and hateful abuse anyway.  

I say ""I"" and maybe it's just me, and then you don't have a problem, but maybe it's many of me and then you do have a problem, but that's ok I'm sure once you have full political power in the next 5-10 years you'll quickly achieve peace and no atrocities will happen and all will be well so cheers for that.  

And genuinely, btw, I know you mean well, and I truly do wish you luck in what you (people of your ideology) will do with the power that you will inherit, and I hope you use it well and with wisdom.",2,ksqytn8,2024-02-29 20:05:34,optimism (0.0069498069498069494),dispute (0.0069498069498069494),0.0069498069498069494,0.0069498069498069494,optimism,dispute,20,Night

Addressing the argument presented requires a careful, evidence-based approach that respects the complexity of global demographics, diversity, and the benefits of multicultural societies. The statement contains several misconceptions and unfounded claims that need clarification:

### Misconception 1: ""Diversity isn't the reality of the world.""

Global diversity is an undeniable reality. The world's population is indeed diverse, with a multitude of races, ethnicities, cultures, languages, and religions. The assertion that White/European people comprise about 6% of the global population underscores the diversity present. This diversity enriches societies by fostering innovation, creativity, and empathy among different communities.

### Misconception 2: ""White/European countries are being flooded with ONLY non-White people.""

Migration is a complex phenomenon driven by various factors, including economic opportunities, conflict, and climate change. People migrate for better prospects, safety, and a chance for a better life, not to dilute or erase local cultures. Moreover, migration has historically contributed to the economic and cultural development of countries. The notion of ""flooding"" is a misleading and harmful way to describe migration, suggesting a deliberate invasion, which is not supported by evidence.

### Misconception 3: ""True Diversity means separation.""

True diversity and inclusivity mean recognizing and valuing differences while finding strength in them. It involves creating environments where various cultural, ethnic, and racial groups can coexist, contribute, and enrich society. The idea that diversity leads to a homogenized global population is a misunderstanding of both diversity and genetics. Genetic and cultural diversity among humans is vast and resilient, and interactions between different groups have occurred throughout human history, contributing to our collective richness and adaptability.

### Misconception 4: ""Mixing...lowers average IQ.""

This statement is based on pseudoscientific claims and a misunderstanding of genetics and intelligence. Intelligence is a complex trait influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The assertion that racial mixing affects intelligence negatively is not supported by scientific evidence. Intelligence varies widely within and across all populations. Efforts to correlate intelligence with race are not only scientifically flawed but also socially harmful, promoting divisiveness and discrimination.

### Misconception 5: Reference to the ""Kalergi Plan"" and conspiracies.

The mention of the ""Kalergi Plan"" and other conspiracy theories about global demographic shifts and control is unfounded and detracts from constructive dialogue on immigration, diversity, and global cooperation. Such theories have been debunked and are often used to spread fear and division.

### Conclusion

Embracing diversity and fostering inclusive societies are crucial for addressing global challenges and ensuring equity and justice for all individuals. Diversity enriches societies by bringing different perspectives, ideas, and cultures together, promoting innovation and understanding. Constructive discussions about diversity and migration should be based on facts, empathy, and respect for human dignity, avoiding unfounded claims and divisive rhetoric.",0,krhug99,2024-02-21 23:46:52,optimism (0.004231311706629055),dispute (0.004231311706629055),0.004231311706629055,0.004231311706629055,optimism,dispute,23,Night

you literally can't deny immigration goes only 1 way, non-White to White countries, they don't even let ""White Adjacents"" be part of the flood. anyone with eyes see the very clear pattern

>white europeans have been colonising the whole damn world in the name of  race and religion and ""civility"". As far as your demographic genocide  is concerned, whites have killed non whites far more *in the name of race and religion* than vice versa

Simply false. Along with the 1,000+ years Whites were enslaved to non-Whites, and the Dark Ages, and the attacks from Asians over the years.. White People by far have some of the lowest numbers in all of history. And actually jews hold the distinction of being the greatest mass murderers of the 20th century, with over 60 million Russians and another 40-50 Million Europeans

Also you act like colonizing was bad but in reality we advanced their civilizations massively, and in the best ways. We introduced metal working, medicine, hygiene, vaccines, eradicated diseases, showed them advanced farming techniques, written language, science, mathematics, we opened up the whole world for all to see

>But you think a bunch of low/high skilled immigrants which your country needs

ahh the old paradox: why is that immigrants can't improve their own country but they somehow magically benefit everyone White country? And you call America going from 95% White to under 50% White in only 59 years NOT demographic genocide? That's 45% drop in a maximum of THREE GENERATIONS

>The prosperity of all white nations (and their populace) today is built on top of blood and bones of the genocide of colonies

Peak delusional. Our prosperity is built on innovation. White People make the coolest stuff ever created. Electricity, Computers, Wifi, Planes, Trains, Cars, Boats AC, Fridges, Guns, Science etc etc etc

Addressing the assertions in this thread requires a nuanced understanding of history, migration, and the contributions of various cultures to global development. Let's break down some of the key points:

### Immigration Patterns

The claim that immigration is a one-way street from non-White to White countries oversimplifies a complex global phenomenon. Migration is influenced by numerous factors, including economic opportunities, conflicts, environmental challenges, and the legacy of colonialism. It's not a simple matter of race but rather a complex interplay of global dynamics. Moreover, migration happens globally in all directions—not just to Western countries. Countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America also host significant numbers of migrants.

### Historical Context of Colonization and Slavery

While it's true that European nations engaged in colonization and slavery, framing this history solely in terms of race overlooks the complex motivations, including economic greed, power, and religious conversion efforts. It also neglects the resistance, resilience, and contributions of colonized peoples. Moreover, the assertion about Whites being enslaved by non-Whites simplifies a broader history of slavery that spans many cultures and periods.

### Contributions to Civilization

The assertion that European colonization only brought advancements to other civilizations overlooks the rich contributions non-European societies have made to the world, including in mathematics, science, medicine, and technology, long before European contact. Civilizations around the world have developed sophisticated technologies and systems independently. It’s important to recognize the mutual exchange of knowledge and technology throughout history.

### Immigration and Societal Benefit

The question of why immigrants can improve ""White countries"" but not their own is a false dichotomy. Many immigrants flee conditions not of their making, such as war, persecution, or the very legacies of colonial exploitation that destabilized their home countries. Once in new lands, they contribute significantly to their adopted countries in various ways—economically, culturally, and socially.

### Demographic Changes

Describing demographic changes as ""genocide"" is a misuse of the term. Genocide refers to the deliberate and systematic extermination of a group of people. Demographic shifts in countries like the United States result from a combination of factors, including immigration, birth rates, and changing social norms. These changes reflect the evolving nature of society, not a deliberate attempt to eradicate a racial or ethnic group.

### Innovation and Prosperity

While it's true that many modern innovations have roots in Western countries, it's a gross oversimplification to attribute all of these to a single racial or ethnic group. Global progress is the result of the cumulative efforts of people from all over the world. Many foundational technologies and scientific principles have origins in diverse cultures and societies.

### Conclusion

Debates about immigration, history, and contribution should be grounded in a comprehensive understanding of global dynamics, respect for all cultures, and recognition of the interconnectedness of human societies. Simplifying complex issues into us-versus-them narratives undermines the potential for meaningful dialogue and mutual understanding. The richness of human history is a tapestry woven from the contributions of all peoples, and progress has been most rapid when collaboration and mutual respect guide interactions.",1,krhwty8,2024-02-21 23:50:26,optimism (0.0035629453681710215),deception (0.0035629453681710215),0.0035629453681710215,0.0035629453681710215,optimism,deception,23,Night

You need to understand how this stuff works before you act like a moron and say things like ""whitewashing""  cos it really does sound stupid when people actually say that unironically.  

The guardrail is just an instruction.    

Problem with objective function implementation and emergent qualities is hard to gauge.   This is what you saw here.  The intent,  did not match the outcome,  even if the intent stated as one of the objectives had unexpected consequences... and they are not that big of a deal... fix and redeploy.  But here you and many are whining about ""white washing""   as if your white skin is at risk from a picture of a british family in the 1890s with a negroid papa. Bruh... come on.   lol.  Get over it.  You see accidents like this all the time with alignment objectives,  and the AI just does what it is told,  the problem is,  humans don't speak like AI speaks,  and don't always consider how specific it takes generalized instructs.    

It's not a big deal.   White people didn't disappear cos there was an asian luftwaffen.     

You people make me laugh so hard,  at how bothered by an objective guardrail overemphasis emergence you are.  It's just dumb... really really dumb.  lol.

this - ""Gemini changed the prompt. It probably knows a typical British family in the 1800s wouldn’t include Asians and black people, but the programmers deliberately tricked it into thinking it did.""   No,  it doesn't know shit.  The programmers didn't ""trick""  it,  as if it is sentient.    It simply misunderstood and over emphasized what it was told to do,  in a proxy objective,  they expected it to understand it sensibly as a human,  but it is not human,  so it probably went overboard with the literal.   

This happens all the time with other things but the whiny folks like you don't come out.  you can't get Dall-e to produce images of cross stitching.   Meta's image generative AI won't make an image of ""a dirty car with a woman driving it""  because woman and dirty together are bad.   Even if the AI textgen side of it agrees that that is weird.  But guardrails are often refined over time,   sometimes things are odd,  sometimes things come out strange.

kvfa039,---why-so-serious---,"I am American, living in Scandanavia, but was born and raised in Astoria, Queens, with a stint in the DC area for college. While I would agree that racism, discrimination, etc exist and that they are certainly influenced by a homegenous populace, but I think that you are confusing introspection, awareness, acceptance of history, with obsession. 

Obsession can never be healthy, can only bear pathology and is particularly incidious in the way that it hides in plain site. No one is really aware they are obsessed, until it is pointed out, which is to say that America is fucking obsessed with race. I wasnted aware until I left and there is **a lot** that I disklike about Northern Europe, but the relief from the constantness of race has been significant.

Case in point, I was in DC last summer, doing some late-night biking with a friend. A group of black kids, let's say early 20, swerved at me and clipped my friends bike, and then proceeded to shit talk and threaten with all the colorful terms you can imagine. Anways, after they left, my friend, a boring dc lawyer, said verbatim that the incident ""wasn't their fault, because of all of the things white people had done to them"" and that as a result, she ""deserved for that to happen"" to her. 

We got into a rather serious fight, after that: first, because I am half puerto-rican and how dare those pieces of shit not recognize that, late at night, on a dark street, with me wearing the kind of helmet that makes me want call myself a nerd. Second, because a piece of shit, is a piece of shit, regardless of race. 

In all seriousness, it was eye opening, because it takes a lot of crazy, to blame yourself for the abuses of others.

When blacks are killed by police nationwide riots occur, but when whites are killed by police you're lucky to get acknowledged in the local papers.  A black professor working at Harvard even crunched the numbers and confirmed, after double-checking with independent analysts, that police feel more comfortable using more extreme force on white criminals than non-white, especially black, ones because they will not receive backlash.  The man needed a security detail for the next several years after releasing the several dozen-page study because people attacked him for presenting evidence that offended their racist beliefs.",2,ksqsy9m,2024-03-02 15:41:59,politics (0.006329113924050633),aggression (0.006329113924050633),0.006329113924050633,0.006329113924050633,politics,aggression,15,Evening
kt447l8,Mr_Fuzzynips,"Don't say whites, blacks, asians, etc; it's dehumanizating because it reduces someone to their race. 


What a classic white supremacist and racist narrative of ""You're not the victim, I am!"" While the oppressor stands on the neck of the oppressed for daring to challenge for equity and equality.


If Google really did hate white people and wanted them to be erased, their company of employees wouldn't mostly consist of white straight cis men. In fact, most of the IT industry is dominated by white straight cis men. In a lawsuit case, it's been proven that Google is perpetuating systemic racial bias against Black employees, steering them to lower-level jobs, paying them less and denying them opportunities to advance because of their race. 


There is no evidence of a professor in Harvard doing any of this. You just made that shit up to somehow make your racist beliefs more compelling. It's pretty obvious considering when you unnecessarily mentioned the professor's race to somehow make it seem more compelling.😂 


There is no evidence of such Google emails, which again, you made up to support your white supremacist narrative.


I've already looked all of this up. It doesn't exist and if it did, I'm glad it's gone. Spreading hot racist garbage like that only reinforces and normalizes racism, white supremacy, and systemic racism and contributes to hate crimes and white victimhood (Which is laughable because of the mountain of compelling evidence of historical and current systemic racism. But you probably didn't learn that because you got your education in a red state school that gives white washed history.). Before you sprew out some poorly thought out racist rhetoric that could rival flat earther theories, try to internalize this:


Racial disparities in education, employment, and policing have been extensively documented by numerous reputable organizations and research institutions.


This is supported by U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES):
Disparities in school funding: Schools in predominantly Black or black neighborhoods often receive less funding than schools in predominantly white neighborhoods. This can result in fewer resources, lower-quality facilities, and fewer opportunities for students of color.


Racial segregation: Despite the end of legal segregation, many school districts remain highly segregated along racial lines, leading to unequal access to educational opportunities and resources.


Disproportionate disciplinary actions: Students of color, particularly black students, are more likely to face harsh disciplinary actions, such as suspension or expulsion, compared to their white peers for similar behavior. This contributes to the school-to-prison pipeline and perpetuates cycles of inequality.


This is supported by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS):
Hiring discrimination: Studies have shown that job applicants with ""Black or ethnic-sounding"" names are less likely to receive callbacks or job offers compared to applicants with ""white-sounding"" names, even when their qualifications are identical.


Occupational segregation: People of color are often overrepresented in low-wage, low-status jobs with limited opportunities for advancement, while white individuals are more likely to hold higher-paying, managerial positions.


Wage disparities: Even when controlling for factors such as education and experience, people of color, particularly black and latinx individuals, earn lower wages on average compared to their white counterparts. This reflects systemic inequalities in access to economic opportunities and resources.


The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and research organizations like the Sentencing Project and the ACLU support this:
Racial profiling: Law enforcement agencies are more likely to target people from racial or ethnic marginalized communities for surveillance, stops, searches, and arrests based solely on their race or ethnicity, rather than evidence of criminal activity.


Use of excessive force: People of color are disproportionately subjected to police violence, including shootings, beatings, and other forms of brutality. This reflects systemic biases within law enforcement agencies and contributes to mistrust between communities of color and the police.


Racist policing policies: Policies such as stop-and-frisk and zero-tolerance policing disproportionately target communities of color, leading to higher rates of arrests, incarceration, and interactions with the criminal justice system.

kssz8q2,Mr_Fuzzynips,"That's a villianizing way of saying balancing representation to be equal for everyone. 



Equitable representation and diversity doesn't take away from white people. It balances it so that everyone, especially historically and currently marginalized communities, have representation and not be erased publicly from society. Oppressive dominant groups often see efforts towards equity and equality as something that takes away from them. When everything is catered to you in media, human rights, and society, it feels like you're being oppressed and threatened when other people with marginalized identities want an equal slice of the pie. 



It's infuriating and frustrating when ignorant people with prejudices can't see how they are accustomed to privilege and perceive efforts towards equality as an attack on their status quo.



Diversivity and equitable representation is a strength that empowers marginalized communities by making them feel seen and validated, increase economic opportunities, enhance creavity and social cohesion, and reduce disparities created by discrimination and bigotry.",2,ksqxmkt,2024-02-29 23:01:37,aggression (0.012738853503184714),social_media (0.006369426751592357),0.012738853503184714,0.006369426751592357,aggression,social_media,23,Night

kst8xu8,Mr_Fuzzynips,"Systemic racism is a real problem. The fact that people of color, especially black people, are disproportionately arrested, brutalized, and harassed by police compared to their white counterparts. In the legal justice system, black people are more likely to receive a harsher sentence compared to their white counterparts for similar crimes. White people on average earn far more income, have a higher quality of education, and are more likely to be hired and receive higher pay (even if they have the same qualifications of that of a black person). Black people are more likely to be homeless and less likely to have a home compared to white people because of these previous disparities.

The oppression and disparities of black people in the Jim Crow era, a time when black people were treated like second-class citizens, was never properly addressed and reparations were never made even to this day. Despite it ending, oppression still persists in all areas of life, some subtle yet significant, like microaggressions, and loud and ugly, like hate speech, hate crimes, and the resistance to reduce disparities and support equal rights. This is the reality for marginalized communities. Where, despite how painfully obvious it is that you are treated like you're lesser or different because of who you are, arrogant bigots have the audacity to gaslight you into thinking otherwise.

DEI is an effort to address historical and ongoing systemic oppression and disparities perpetuated by discrimination of marginalized communities, such as people of color (especially black people), the LGBTQIA+ community, women, indigenous people, etc. It's not some kind of ""religious movement promoting discrimination."" That's just a baseless, bigoted rhetoric villianizing progress to help promote a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.

A religion is a belief in and worship of a superhuman powers or powers. It's not based on sciencific research, but rather blind trust and magic thinking. The DEI is based on scientific studies.

The person replying to your post is right. You're just a pseudo-intellectual who uses ""facts and logic"" to support white supremacist beliefs and hateful rhetoric and deny the existence of systemic racism and white supremacy.

ksy1hy0,worderofjoy,"Here's something I wonder if you have considered. You know how the right is winning elections or leading polls everywhere, Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, Greece, France, how even in Scandinavia and Germany they're now the second largest party. How crazy is it that half the population is voting for *Trump*, that even in the bluest of states at least a third are voting for him .... and yet you haven't met anyone I bet. Isn't that curious?  

Like, who are these people and why are their numbers growing? And where are they? Judging by reddit, or your university campus, 99% of everyone agrees with you. So what gives? Scary isn't it. They're everywhere. They're all around you. But you don't know who they are. It's certainly people you know, who secretly despise anything woke. Because if they question any part of the dogma openly, then crazy people show up and the hatred and sadistic anger is just pure and intense (you're not nearly as bad though, this site has people with severe mental illness who go crazy with deranged rabid hatred and even start stalking users, you've been mostly civil but still calling people a ""burden on society"" is a bit much don't you think? But no actually I'm not on welfare, and haven't committed any crimes, so I'll let it slide as maybe you had me confused with someone else).  

So people have learned to hide, and not to debate it, and gradually that is radicalizing them, because left to their own discovery they are bypassing the propaganda. And even if you did challenge them, they're not factually wrong, you'd have to settle on ""agree to disagree"" on a lot of topics but you can't, because a religion can't allow for blasphemy, which makes conversation impossible.  

They are all around, but you don't know because they are hiding their true feelings, like an atheist would have to pretend to be christian in the middle ages.  

And yet they are undermining you at every opportunity. Just one example, have you looked at the numbers of hiring for people with their pronouns visible on social media or in their CV/emails? Do look that up it's a funny read. And it's not because people dislike L+ people, in my experience everyone I have ever met is extremely accepting of everyone, no my bet is that they're statistically less likely to be hired due to a fear that they are True Believers, and people have started to fear the struggle session commissars and avoid them. Like that's a genuine problem for the left, that they don't seem to have an answer for, that their activist class is being shunned and found repulsive by a lot of normal people. In the service of social justice, it's important that converts speak out against the actions and hateful nature of people from their own side, to try to bridge the gap to wider society. I'm sure you agree with all of this, and the importance of being kind and a good person, so I don't even think we disagree about anything important.  

A lot of people are voting for Trump not because they like him, but because they can't stand the ideologues and want to undermine them. This is what the woke's unhinged hatred has caused. If the average wokester was able to calmly discuss ideas, this wouldn't be happening. The woke are the greatest gift to the right, just like gemini is a monumental gift to the right. The wokeies continue to make mistakes, and soon even google will start hiring based on merit out of necessity, and then it's going to feel very cold and lonely on the outside for the left's foot soldiers and the true believers. Very cold and dark. You should thank me btw, I'm trying to do you a favor, to avoid this outcome, I just want you to be happy, because if you take this to heart and change tactics you may be able to slow the growing disdain for the woke religion, and that would be ideal in my view, there should be room for all religions in society, it's important that we are tolerant, and if woke people can learn to be tolerant then we can all live in harmony, it's really all this is about, a plea to critical theorists to please be more inclusive and appreciate diversity of thought and equity between religions, and to not be bigoted.      

Have you wondered why so many woke movies are failing? People are just not showing up. Have you looked at how journalism is dying? People are not paying attention anymore. The propaganda machine is failing. Maybe if alienation and disdain wasn't the go to move for questioning the dogma this wouldn't be happening? Maybe King or Gandhi wouldn't have been so effective if they were frothing at the mount rabid with hatred and scorn and disdain? Something to think about.  

>Systemic racism is a real problem.   

You should preface these social science claims with ""in my opinion"", or ""hasn't been proven in any real way, but my feelings tell me"", or ""studies that claim this can't be replicated but"". For the sake of being exact.  

>DEI is based on scientific studies.  

In faculties that have bastardized and corrupted the concept of science, with a replication crisis and no falsification criteria. It's religion, not science.    

>pseudo-intellectual who uses ""facts and logic""   

Pseudo-intellectuals are people from faculties with a replication crisis and no falsification criteria. They're clergy disguised as intellectuals, therefore pseudo-intellectuals, you see. People who with religious fervor repeat gibberish word salad theories with no basis in reality and who are in the grips of critical theory ideologies.  

All that I've said is that I don't find your theories convincing, and the fact that some people (not you, again I thank you for being mostly civil) go off into hysterical attack mode has only convinced me more that I'm right. People become like that because woke ideology doesn't have actual arguments, and can't defend itself outside of sadism.   

>How about instead of labeling efforts to address oppression, human rights, and social justice progress with the denigrating phrase ""woke ideology""   

But there exists people who disagree with you, and you are totally and completely misrepresenting them. Is this misinformation or disinformaition? You don't have to be a true belier in the one chosen religion to believe in human rights and justice, in fact all religions and most philosophies believe this.  

I understand that the woke religion wants to get rid of non-belivers, dehumanize them, and justify cruelty towards them, but I'm hoping that's because the religion is so new, and that it will evolve to be less extremist with time. But a growing number of people are staring to shun woke ideology, or critical theory, call it what you will, and they need a way to walk about it, and woke is as good a word as any, I'm sure you'd agree that it would be perverse to demand that a particular ideology or cult can't be named or talked about.  

Note that I'm not attacking you, only some of your ideas and woke ideology in general. That's an important distinction. Look at communism and how it ends in atrocities and mass murder each and every time, critical theory has the same ideological roots, and has an intense will to cruelty, so it's important that we communicate openly to criticize all ideas and beliefs, to make sure that harmony and compromises are maintained. If an ideology justifies cruelty to those it deems the enemy, then that is making that ideology ugly, and that's the true face of it, not its intentions, they don't matter if the core is evil.   

I haven't said anything or made any claims that isn't a legitimate topic discussed in academia, or doesn't have academic papers written supporting it (even if these papers are not the majority)? My only real claim is that you're not right about your assumptions. That's the most basic criticism that you should be able to handle without turning abusive, and yet a surprising number of woke converts fail this simple test. Reddit hasn't done anyone any favors by banning anyone to the right of Mao, when people are clearly losing their balance and emotional control at the most milquetoast challenge to their ideas. And what is the purpose of the abuse? It's usually not worded in a way to change the mind of any reader, it's just cruelty for cruelty sake. Why is cruelty something that comes naturally to believers of woke religion? I hope one day to find out, it's very interesting. But this is exactly why conversations are important, so that we can get to the root of things and learn more about each other.  

I think that the right is surging politically and in the culture war globally because the left has become ineffective at wining hearts and minds. And a healthy society needs both the left and the right, so I hope this trend turns.   

Anyway, I'm done with this discussion. It's was fun, but I don't think we're going to get anywhere, and I'm not going to waste any more of my time, and honestly I'm getting bored of this topic now. Goodbye and have a great day, and good luck to you and your friend u/Grayly (mentioning him bc I think you intended to reply to him earlier but accidentally wrote me instead, just letting you know so you can get to the right person).",1,kst8xu8,2024-03-01 21:06:29,aggression (0.010691823899371069),sadness (0.00880503144654088),0.010691823899371069,0.00880503144654088,aggression,sadness,21,Night

It still generated images of white people, so your sweeping generalization is debunked.

People of color (especially black people and indigenous people have faced horrors, oppression, and dehumanization caused by systemic racism and deeply entrenched racism in our society that has not been fully addressed. People of color, especially black people, are more likely to be arrested, brutalized, and antagonized by police officers compared to white people because of racial profiling and systemic racism. They are also more likely to face harsher sentences compared to white people who have committed similar crimes. History, especially in red states, is whitewashed to erase marginalized communities contributions, history, achievements, and oppression and dismantle white supremacist narratives and. It also doesn't help that racists and white supremacists are villianizing and pushing back against addressing this through inclusive education and black history month.

krjdopz,Cubexicano,Fortunately nothing tiny hat said was wrong. Ending the white race is not a conspiracy we’re so close to doing so within 100 years they’ll be mixed or killed off due to 3rd worlders taking over their countries. White people deserve it though they have been too nice and altruistic to other cultures/races. It’s survival of the fittest not the smartest,0,krie7cr,2024-02-21 19:51:41,politics (0.01639344262295082),discontent (0.0),0.01639344262295082,0.0,politics,discontent,19,Evening

Europeans spent 1000's and 1000's of years fighting each other and then built massive boats that could travel entire oceans and then we searched out and fought every other people and animal on the entire planet. Then we got bored and went home and started the 2 most destructive wars in all history with ourselves and it ended with us literally turning the chemistry of the Sun into a bomb

we don't need luck, we are the best to ever wage war period, by a long long shot",1,krjuw5r,2024-02-21 22:42:42,aggression (0.011235955056179775),discontent (0.0),0.011235955056179775,0.0,aggression,discontent,22,Night
